	abstract = {Most of our knowledge about vision comes from experiments in which stimuli are presented to immobile human subjects or animals. In the case of human subjects, movement during psychophysical, electrophysiological, or neuroimaging experiments is considered to be a source of noise to be eliminated. Animals used in visual neuroscience experiments are typically restrained and, in many cases, anesthetized. In reality, however, vision is often used to guide the motion of awake, ambulating organisms. Recent work in mice has shown that locomotion elevates visual neuronal response amplitudes (Niell and Stryker, 2010; Erisken et al., 2014; Fu et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014; Mineault et al., 2016) and reduces long-range gain control (Ayaz et al., 2013). Here, we used both psychophysics and steady-state electrophysiology to investigate whether similar effects of locomotion on early visual processing can be measured in humans. Our psychophysical results show that brisk walking has little effect on subjects' ability to detect briefly presented contrast changes and that co-oriented flankers are, if anything, more effective masks when subjects are walking. Our electrophysiological data were consistent with the psychophysics indicating no increase in stimulus-driven neuronal responses while walking and no reduction in surround suppression. In summary, we have found evidence that early contrast processing is altered by locomotion in humans but in a manner that differs from that reported in mice. The effects of locomotion on very low-level visual processing may differ on a species-by-species basis and may reflect important differences in the levels of arousal associated with locomotion.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mice are the current model of choice for studying low-level visual processing. Recent studies have shown that mouse visual cortex is modulated by behavioral state: primary visual cortex neurons in locomoting mice tend to be more sensitive and less influenced by long-range gain control. Here, we tested these effects in humans by measuring psychophysical detection thresholds and electroencephalography (EEG) responses while subjects walked on a treadmill. We found no evidence of increased contrast sensitivity or reduced surround suppression in walking humans. Our data show that fundamental measurements of early visual processing differ between humans and mice and this has important implications for recent work on the links among arousal, behavior, and vision in these two species.},

@article{Cannon1993,
	abstract = {The apparent contrast of a small grating patch embedded in the center of an annular grating filled surround was studied as a function of the surround to central patch contrast ratio, the width of the annulus, and the contrast level of the central patch. Data from ten observers show large individual differences in apparent contrast, but these differences can be interpreted in terms of the relative strength of two interacting mechanisms. One mechanism mediates enhancement of the central patch. The other mediates suppression.},

@article{Meese2009,
	abstract = {Contrast masking from parallel grating surrounds (doughnuts) and superimposed orthogonal masks have different characteristics. However, it is not known whether the saturation of the underlying suppression that has been found for parallel doughnut masks depends on (i) relative mask and target orientation, (ii) stimulus eccentricity or (iii) surround suppression. We measured contrast-masking functions for target patches of grating in the fovea and in the periphery for cross-oriented superimposed and doughnut masks and parallel doughnut masks. When suppression was evident, the factor that determined whether it accelerated or saturated was whether the mask stimulus was crossed or parallel. There are at least two interpretations of the asymptotic behaviour of the parallel surround mask. (1) Suppression arises from pathways that saturate with (mask) contrast. (2) The target is processed by a mechanism that is subject to surround suppression at low target contrasts, but a less sensitive mechanism that is immune from surround suppression 'breaks through' at higher target contrasts. If the mask can be made less potent, then masking functions should shift downwards, and sideways for the two accounts, respectively. We manipulated the potency of the mask by varying the size of the hole in a parallel doughnut mask. The results provided strong evidence for the first account but not the second. On the view that response compression becomes more severe progressing up the visual pathway, our results suggest that superimposed cross-orientation suppression precedes orientation tuned surround suppression. These results also reveal a previously unrecognized similarity between surround suppression and crowding (Pelli, Palomares, & Majaj, 2004).},

@article{Li2005,
	abstract = {The response of a cell in the primary visual cortex to an optimally oriented grating is suppressed by a superimposed orthogonal grating. This cross-orientation suppression (COS) is exhibited when the orthogonal and optimal stimuli are presented to the same eye (monoptically) or to different eyes (dichoptically). A recent study suggested that monoptic COS arises from subcortical processes; however, the mechanisms underlying dichoptic COS were not addressed. We have compared the temporal frequency tuning and stimulus adaptation properties of monoptic and dichoptic COS. We found that dichoptic COS is best elicited with lower temporal frequencies and is substantially reduced after prolonged adaptation to a mask grating. In contrast, monoptic COS is more pronounced with mask gratings at much higher temporal frequencies and is less prone to stimulus adaptation. These results suggest that monoptic COS is mediated by subcortical mechanisms, whereas intracortical inhibition is the mechanism for dichoptic COS.},

@article{Baker2007,
	abstract = {Visual mechanisms in primary visual cortex are suppressed by the superposition of gratings perpendicular to their preferred orientations. A clear picture of this process is needed to (i) inform functional architecture of image-processing models, (ii) identify the pathways available to support binocular rivalry, and (iii) generally advance our understanding of early vision. Here we use monoptic sine-wave gratings and cross-orientation masking (XOM) to reveal two cross-oriented suppressive pathways in humans, both of which occur before full binocular summation of signals. One is a within-eye (ipsiocular) pathway that is spatially broadband, immune to contrast adaptation and has a suppressive weight that tends to decrease with stimulus duration. The other pathway operates between the eyes (interocular), is spatially tuned, desensitizes with contrast adaptation and has a suppressive weight that increases with stimulus duration. When cross-oriented masks are presented to both eyes, masking is enhanced or diminished for conditions in which either ipsiocular or interocular pathways dominate masking, respectively. We propose that ipsiocular suppression precedes the influence of interocular suppression and tentatively associate the two effects with the lateral geniculate nucleus (or retina) and the visual cortex respectively. The interocular route is a good candidate for the initial pathway involved in binocular rivalry and predicts that interocular cross-orientation suppression should be found in cortical cells with predominantly ipsiocular drive.},

@article{Petrov2005,
	abstract = {Cortical visual neurons in the cat and monkey are inhibited by stimuli surrounding their receptive fields (surround suppression) or presented within their receptive fields (cross-orientation or overlay suppression). We show that human contrast sensitivity is similarly affected by two distinct suppression mechanisms. In agreement with the animal studies, human surround suppression is tightly tuned to the orientation and spatial frequency of the test, unlike overlay suppression. Using a double-masking paradigm, we also show that in humans, overlay suppression precedes surround suppression in the processing sequence. Surprisingly, we find that, unlike overlay suppression, surround suppression is only strong in the periphery (> 1 degree eccentricity). This result argues for a new functional distinction between foveal and peripheral operations.},
