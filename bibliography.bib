@article{Regan1988,
	abstract = {Response asymmetry (e.g. to light ON vs. OFF), a frequently encountered property of neurons at both peripheral and central levels in sensory pathways, can be modelled as a rectifier. When fed with the sum of two sinusoids of frequencies F1 and F2 Hz, the output of a rectifier contains multiple discrete frequency components of frequency (nF1 $\pm$ mF2) where n and m are zero or integers. We describe a double Fourier series method for obtaining the amplitudes and phases of these components for physiologically relevant neural models including (1) compressive, linear, accelerating and mixed compressive/accelerating single model neurons, (2) a cascaded series of model neurons and (3) the parallel/cascaded case corresponding to dichoptic or dichotic stimulation. If one of the inputs is held constant while the other's amplitude is varied, we obtain a family of curves---one for each (nF1 $\pm$ mF2) component. The family of curves seems to be characteristic of the particular non-linear system. Neural models may be tested by first calculating the family of curves and then comparing these theoretical data with a physiologically measured family of curves. Illustrating this approach, we compare the predictions of case (1) and case (2) models with the family of curves obtained by stimulating with F1 Hz flicker of fixed modulation depth superimposed on F2 Hz flicker of variable modulation depth. Evoked brain responses were analysed by non-destructive zoom-FFT giving resolution up to the Heisenberg-Gabor limit of ΔF = ΔT−1, where ΔT is the recording duration. Thus, for example, the spectrum could contain 50 000 lines over a D.C.-100 Hz bandwidth for a 500 second recording duration. Empirically, the bandwidth of discrete physiological components is no more than 0·004 Hz. Like the Wiener kernel time-domain approach, this frequency-domain approach is restricted to time-invariant systems with a limited settling time and without appreciable hysteresis. On the other hand, the Weiner kernel approach seems to handle dynamic systems more conveniently. But this frequency-domain method has the important advantage that different signal components are well separated from each other and from noise, whereas signal and noise overlap in the time domain. Consequently, high-order terms are more easily recorded using the frequency domain method, thus giving sharper distinctions between candidate non-linear models.},

@article{Pelli2004,
	abstract = {A letter in the peripheral visual field is much harder to identify in the presence of nearby letters. This is "crowding." Both crowding and ordinary masking are special cases of "masking," which, in general, refers to any effect of a "mask" pattern on the discriminability of a signal. Here we characterize crowding, and propose a diagnostic test to distinguish it from ordinary masking. In ordinary masking, the signal disappears. In crowding, it remains visible, but is ambiguous, jumbled with its neighbors. Masks are usually effective only if they overlap the signal, but the crowding effect extends over a large region. The width of that region is proportional to signal eccentricity from the fovea and independent of signal size, mask size, mask contrast, signal and mask font, and number of masks. At 4 deg eccentricity, the threshold contrast for identification of a 0.32 deg signal letter is elevated (up to six-fold) by mask letters anywhere in a 2.3 deg region, 7 times wider than the signal. In ordinary masking, threshold contrast rises as a power function of mask contrast, with a shallow log-log slope of 0.5 to 1, whereas, in crowding, threshold is a sigmoidal function of mask contrast, with a steep log-log slope of 2 at close spacing. Most remarkably, although the threshold elevation decreases exponentially with spacing, the threshold and saturation contrasts of crowding are independent of spacing. Finally, ordinary masking is similar for detection and identification, but crowding occurs only for identification, not detection. More precisely, crowding occurs only in tasks that cannot be done based on a single detection by coarsely coded feature detectors. These results (and observers' introspections) suggest that ordinary masking blocks feature detection, so the signal disappears, while crowding (like "illusory conjunction") is excessive feature integration - detected features are integrated over an inappropriately large area because there are no smaller integration fields - so the integrated signal is ambiguous, jumbled with the mask. In illusory conjunction, observers see an object that is not there made up of features that are. A survey of the illusory conjunction literature finds that most of the illusory conjunction results are consistent with the spatial crowding described here, which depends on spatial proximity, independent of time pressure. The rest seem to arise through a distinct phenomenon that one might call "temporal crowding," which depends on time pressure ("overloading attention"), independent of spatial proximity.},

@article{Kontsevich1999,
	abstract = {The influential uncertainty model [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 2, 1508 (1985)] attributes nonlinear contrast sensitivity near threshold to the inability of the observer to discriminate between the signal from stimulated locations and the noise from nonstimulated locations. We introduce an alternative interpretation, the distraction model, to describe the behavior of an observer who knows exactly which location was stimulated but may miss the test stimulus because attention has been distracted by irrelevant (noise) signals. For any stimulus sample, the observer is assumed to be certain of whether this sample is relevant or irrelevant to the stimulus. The non-linear effects predicted by the distraction model without uncertainty are similar to those predicted by the uncertainty model.},

@article{Pelli1985,
	abstract = {More than 20 years ago, Tanner [Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 89, 752 (1961)] noted that observers asked to detect a signal act as though they are uncertain about the physical characteristics of the signal to be detected. The popular assumptions of probability summation and decision variable, taken together, imply this uncertainty. This paper defines and uncertainty model of visual detection that assumes that the observer is uncertain among many signals and chooses the likeliest. With only four parameters, the uncertainty model explains why d' is approximately a power function of contrast ("nonlinear transduction") and accurately predicts effects of summation, facilitation, noise, subjective criterion, and task for near-threshold contrast. Thus the uncertainty model offers a synthesis of much of our current understanding of visual contrast detection and discrimination.},

@article{Baker2007b,
	abstract = {To decouple interocular suppression and binocular summation we varied the relative phase of mask and target in a 2IFC contrast-masking paradigm. In Experiment I, dichoptic mask gratings had the same orientation and spatial frequency as the target. For in-phase masking, suppression was strong (a log-log slope of approximately 1) and there was weak facilitation at low mask contrasts. Anti-phase masking was weaker (a log-log slope of approximately 0.7) and there was no facilitation. A two-stage model of contrast gain control [Meese, T.S., Georgeson, M.A. and Baker, D.H. (2006). Binocular contrast vision at and above threshold. Journal of Vision, 6: 1224-1243] provided a good fit to the in-phase results and fixed its free parameters. It made successful predictions (with no free parameters) for the anti-phase results when (A) interocular suppression was phase-indifferent but (B) binocular summation was phase sensitive. Experiments II and III showed that interocular suppression comprised two components: (i) a tuned effect with an orientation bandwidth of approximately +/-33 degrees and a spatial frequency bandwidth of >3 octaves, and (ii) an untuned effect that elevated threshold by a factor of between 2 and 4. Operationally, binocular summation was more tightly tuned, having an orientation bandwidth of approximately +/-8 degrees , and a spatial frequency bandwidth of approximately 0.5 octaves. Our results replicate the unusual shapes of the in-phase dichoptic tuning functions reported by Legge [Legge, G.E. (1979). Spatial frequency masking in human vision: Binocular interactions. Journal of the Optical Society of America, 69: 838-847]. These can now be seen as the envelope of the direct effects from interocular suppression and the indirect effect from binocular summation, which contaminates the signal channel with a mask that has been suppressed by the target.},

@article{Meese2010,
	abstract = {Most contemporary models of spatial vision include a cross-oriented route to suppression (masking from a broadly tuned inhibitory pool), which is most potent at low spatial and high temporal frequencies (T. S. Meese & D. J. Holmes, 2007). The influence of this pathway can elevate orientation-masking functions without exciting the target mechanism, and because early psychophysical estimates of filter bandwidth did not accommodate this, it is likely that they have been overestimated for this corner of stimulus space. Here we show that a transient 40% contrast mask causes substantial binocular threshold elevation for a transient vertical target, and this declines from a mask orientation of 0$\,^{\circ}$ to about 40$\,^{\circ}$ (indicating tuning), and then more gently to 90$\,^{\circ}$, where it remains at a factor of ∼4. We also confirm that cross-orientation masking is diminished or abolished at high spatial frequencies and for sustained temporal modulation. We fitted a simple model of pedestal masking and cross-orientation suppression (XOS) to our data and those of G. C. Phillips and H. R. Wilson (1984) and found the dependency of orientation bandwidth on spatial frequency to be much less than previously supposed. An extension of our linear spatial pooling model of contrast gain control and dilution masking (T. S. Meese & R. J. Summers, 2007) is also shown to be consistent with our results using filter bandwidths of $\pm$20$\,^{\circ}$. Both models include tightly and broadly tuned components of divisive suppression. More generally, because XOS and/or dilution masking can affect the shape of orientation-masking curves, we caution that variations in bandwidth estimates might reflect variations in processes that have nothing to do with filter bandwidth.},

@article{Holmes2004,
	abstract = {In human vision, the response to luminance contrast at each small region in the image is controlled by a more global process where suppressive signals are pooled over spatial frequency and orientation bands. But what rules govern summation among stimulus components within the suppressive pool? We addressed this question by extending a pedestal plus pattern mask paradigm to use a stimulus with up to three mask components: a vertical 1 c/deg pedestal, plus pattern masks made from either a grating (orientation = -45 degrees ) or a plaid (orientation = +/-45 degrees ), with component spatial frequency of 3 c/deg. The overall contrast of both types of pattern mask was fixed at 20% (i.e., plaid component contrasts were 10%). We found that both of these masks transformed conventional dipper functions (threshold vs. pedestal contrast with no pattern mask) in exactly the same way: The dipper region was raised and shifted to the right, but the dipper handles superimposed. This equivalence of the two pattern masks indicates that contrast summation between the plaid components was perfectly linear prior to the masking stage. Furthermore, the pattern masks did not drive the detecting mechanism above its detection threshold because they did not abolish facilitation by the pedestal (Foley, 1994). Therefore, the pattern masking could not be attributed to within-channel masking, suggesting that linear summation of contrast signals takes place within a suppressive contrast gain pool. We present a quantitative model of the effects and discuss the implications for neurophysiological models of the process.},

@article{Meese2002,
	abstract = {Foley [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 11 (1994) 1710] has proposed an influential psychophysical model of masking in which mask components in a contrast gain pool are raised to an exponent before summation and divisive inhibition. We tested this summation rule in experiments in which contrast detection thresholds were measured for a vertical 1 c/deg (or 2 c/deg) sine-wave component in the presence of a 3 c/deg (or 6 c/deg) mask that had either a single component oriented at -45 degrees or a pair of components oriented at +/-45 degrees. Contrary to the predictions of Foley's model 3, we found that for masks of moderate contrast and above, threshold elevation was predicted by linear summation of the mask components in the inhibitory stage of the contrast gain pool. We built this feature into two new models, referred to as the early adaptation model and the hybrid model. In the early adaptation model, contrast adaptation controls a threshold-like nonlinearity on the output of otherwise linear pathways that provide the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a gain control stage. The hybrid model involves nonlinear and nonadaptable routes to excitatory and inhibitory stages as well as an adaptable linear route. With only six free parameters, both models provide excellent fits to the masking and adaptation data of Foley and Chen [Vision Res. 37 (1997) 2779] but unlike Foley and Chen's model, are able to do so with only one adaptation parameter. However, only the hybrid model is able to capture the features of Foley's (1994) pedestal plus orthogonal fixed mask data. We conclude that (1) linear summation of inhibitory components is a feature of contrast masking, and (2) that the main aftereffect of spatial adaptation on contrast increment thresholds can be assigned to a single site.},

@article{Wang2021,
	abstract = {Stimulus-dependence of gamma oscillations (GAMMA, 30-90 Hz) has not been fully understood, but it is important for revealing neural mechanisms and functions of GAMMA. Here, we recorded spiking activity (MUA) and the local field potential (LFP), driven by a variety of plaids (generated by two superimposed gratings orthogonal to each other and with different contrast combinations), in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized cats. We found two distinct narrow-band GAMMAs in the LFPs and a variety of response patterns to plaids. Similar to MUA, most response patterns showed that the second grating suppressed GAMMAs driven by the first one. However, there is only a weak site-by-site correlation between cross-orientation interactions in GAMMAs and those in MUAs. We developed a normalization model that could unify the response patterns of both GAMMAs and MUAs. Interestingly, compared with MUAs, the GAMMAs demonstrated a wider range of model parameters and more diverse response patterns to plaids. Further analysis revealed that normalization parameters for high GAMMA, but not those for low GAMMA, were significantly correlated with the discrepancy of spatial frequency between stimulus and sites' preferences. Consistent with these findings, normalization parameters and diversity of high GAMMA exhibited a clear transition trend and region difference between area 17 to 18. Our results show that GAMMAs are also regulated in the form of normalization, but that the neural mechanisms for these normalizations might differ from those of spiking activity. Normalizations in different brain signals could be due to interactions of excitation and inhibitions at multiple stages in the visual system.},

@article{Pei2017,
	abstract = {Contrast sensitivity is regulated by neural mechanisms that flexibly adjust responsiveness to optimize stimulus encoding across different environments. Here we studied the developmental status of gain control mechanisms in school-age children (5-17years) and adults using a visual masking paradigm. A variable contrast, spatially random 2-D noise test pattern was masked by the presence of a superimposed independent noise pattern presented at 0, 12 and 40% contrast. Frequency-tagged steady state visual evoked potentials were used to separately record responses to the test (5.14Hz) and the mask (7.2Hz). By incrementally increasing the test contrast we measured contrast response functions for each mask contrast. The unmasked contrast response functions were largely similar in shape across age, but peak amplitude was higher in the children. Masking shifted the contrast response function rightward on the contrast axis in both the adults and older children, elevating contrast thresholds by a similar factor across age. However, in younger children, masking resulted in a change in the slope of the contrast response function. These findings suggest that immaturity in the contrast normalization process persists until approximately 11years of age.},

@article{Yiltiz2020,
	abstract = {Adaptation is the process that changes a neuron's response based on recent inputs. In the traditional model, a neuron's state of adaptation depends on the recent input to that neuron alone, whereas in a recently introduced model (Hebbian normalization), adaptation depends on the structure of neural correlated firing. In particular, increased response products between pairs of neurons leads to increased mutual suppression. We test a psychophysical prediction of this model: adaptation should depend on 2nd-order statistics of input stimuli. That is, if two stimuli excite two distinct sub-populations of neurons, then presenting those stimuli simultaneously during adaptation should strengthen mutual suppression between those subpopulations. We confirm this prediction in two experiments. In the first, pairing two gratings synchronously during adaptation (i.e., a plaid) rather than asynchronously (interleaving the two gratings in time) leads to increased effectiveness of one pattern for masking the other. In the second, pairing the gratings in a center-surround configuration results in reduced apparent contrast for the central grating when paired with the same surround (as compared with a condition in which the central grating appears with a different surround at test than during adaptation). These results are consistent with the prediction that an increase in response covariance leads to greater mutual suppression between neurons. This effect is detectable both at threshold (masking) and well above threshold (apparent contrast).},

@article{Webb2005,
	abstract = {The response of a neuron in striate cortex to an optimally configured visual stimulus is generally reduced when the stimulus is enlarged to encroach on a suppressive region that surrounds its classical receptive field (CRF). To characterize the mechanism that gives rise to this suppression, we measured its spatiotemporal tuning, its susceptibility to contrast adaptation, and its capacity for interocular transfer. Responses to an optimally configured grating confined to the CRF were strongly suppressed by annular surrounding gratings drifting at a wide range of temporal and spatial frequencies (including spatially uniform fields) that extended from well below to well above the range that drives most cortical neurons. Suppression from gratings capable of driving cortical CRFs was profoundly reduced by contrast adaptation and showed substantial interocular transfer. Suppression from stimuli that lay outside the spatiotemporal passband of most cortical CRFs was relatively stronger when the stimulus on the CRF was of low contrast, was generally insusceptible to contrast adaptation, and showed little interocular transfer. Our findings point to the existence of two mechanisms of surround suppression: one that is prominent when high-contrast stimuli drive the CRF, is orientation selective, has relatively sharp spatiotemporal tuning, is binocularly driven, and can be substantially desensitized by adaptation; the other is relatively more prominent when low-contrast stimuli drive the CRF, has very broad spatiotemporal tuning, is monocularly driven, and is insusceptible to adaptation. Its character suggests an origin in the input layers of primary visual cortex, or earlier.},

@article{Westrick2016,
	abstract = {UNLABELLED: Adaptation to an oriented stimulus changes both the gain and preferred orientation of neural responses in V1. Neurons tuned near the adapted orientation are suppressed, and their preferred orientations shift away from the adapter. We propose a model in which weights of divisive normalization are dynamically adjusted to homeostatically maintain response products between pairs of neurons. We demonstrate that this adjustment can be performed by a very simple learning rule. Simulations of this model closely match existing data from visual adaptation experiments. We consider several alternative models, including variants based on homeostatic maintenance of response correlations or covariance, as well as feedforward gain-control models with multiple layers, and we demonstrate that homeostatic maintenance of response products provides the best account of the physiological data.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Adaptation is a phenomenon throughout the nervous system in which neural tuning properties change in response to changes in environmental statistics. We developed a model of adaptation that combines normalization (in which a neuron's gain is reduced by the summed responses of its neighbors) and Hebbian learning (in which synaptic strength, in this case divisive normalization, is increased by correlated firing). The model is shown to account for several properties of adaptation in primary visual cortex in response to changes in the statistics of contour orientation.},

@article{Aschner2018,
	abstract = {A fundamental and nearly ubiquitous feature of sensory encoding is that neuronal responses are strongly influenced by recent experience, or adaptation. Theoretical and computational studies have proposed that many adaptation effects may result in part from changes in the strength of normalization signals. Normalization is a "canonical" computation in which a neuron's response is modulated (normalized) by the pooled activity of other neurons. Here, we test whether adaptation can alter the strength of cross-orientation suppression, or masking, a paradigmatic form of normalization evident in primary visual cortex (V1). We made extracellular recordings of V1 neurons in anesthetized male macaques and measured responses to plaid stimuli composed of two overlapping, orthogonal gratings before and after prolonged exposure to two distinct adapters. The first adapter was a plaid consisting of orthogonal gratings and led to stronger masking. The second adapter presented the same orthogonal gratings in an interleaved manner and led to weaker masking. The strength of adaptation's effects on masking depended on the orientation of the test stimuli relative to the orientation of the adapters, but was independent of neuronal orientation preference. Changes in masking could not be explained by altered neuronal responsivity. Our results suggest that normalization signals can be strengthened or weakened by adaptation depending on the temporal contingencies of the adapting stimuli. Our findings reveal an interplay between two widespread computations in cortical circuits, adaptation and normalization, that enables flexible adjustments to the structure of the environment, including the temporal relationships among sensory stimuli.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Two fundamental features of sensory responses are that they are influenced by adaptation and that they are modulated by the activity of other nearby neurons via normalization. Our findings reveal a strong interaction between these two aspects of cortical computation. Specifically, we show that cross-orientation masking, a form of normalization, can be strengthened or weakened by adaptation depending on the temporal contingencies between sensory inputs. Our findings support theoretical proposals that some adaptation effects may involve altered normalization and offer a network-based explanation for how cortex adjusts to current sensory demands.},

@article{Carandini2002,
	abstract = {The responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are suppressed by mask stimuli that do not elicit responses if presented alone. This suppression is widely believed to be mediated by intracortical inhibition. As an alternative, we propose that it can be explained by thalamocortical synaptic depression. This explanation correctly predicts that suppression is monocular, immune to cortical adaptation, and occurs for mask stimuli that elicit responses in the thalamus but not in the cortex. Depression also explains other phenomena previously ascribed to intracortical inhibition. It explains why responses saturate at high stimulus contrast, whereas selectivity for orientation and spatial frequency is invariant with contrast. It explains why transient responses to flashed stimuli are nonlinear, whereas spatial summation is primarily linear. These results suggest that the very first synapses into the cortex, and not the cortical network, may account for important response properties of V1 neurons.},

@article{Peirce2007,
	abstract = {Most cortical visual neurons do not respond linearly with contrast. Generally, they show saturated responses to stimuli of high contrast, a feature often characterized by a divisive normalization function. This nonlinearity is generally thought to be useful in focusing the dynamic response range of the neuron on a particular region of contrast space, optimizing contrast gain. Some neurons not only saturate but also supersaturate; at high contrast, the response of the neuron decreases rather than plateaus. Under the contrast gain control theory, these cells would seem to reflect a nonoptimal normalization pool that provides excessive inhibition to the neurons. Since very few data on supersaturation are available, this article examines the frequency with which such neurons occur in macaque visual cortex by considering an extension of the Naka-Rushton equation with the capacity to represent nonmonotonic functions. The prevalence of gain-control theories for saturation has occluded an additional computational function for saturation, namely, in detecting the conjunction of certain features. A saturating nonlinearity is a critical part of the selective detection of compound stimuli over their components. In this role, the existence of saturating contrast response functions might be considered necessary rather than simply optimal.},

@article{Bruyns-Haylett2017,
	abstract = {It is generally recognised that event related potentials (ERPs) of electroencephalogram (EEG) primarily reflect summed post-synaptic activity of the local pyramidal neural population(s). However, it is still not understood how the positive and negative deflections (e.g. P1, N1 etc) observed in ERP recordings are related to the underlying excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic activity. We investigated the neurogenesis of P1 and N1 in ERPs by pharmacologically manipulating inhibitory post-synaptic activity in the somatosensory cortex of rodent, and concurrently recording EEG and local field potentials (LFPs). We found that the P1 wave in the ERP and LFP of the supragranular layers is determined solely by the excitatory post-synaptic activity of the local pyramidal neural population, as is the initial segment of the N1 wave across cortical depth. The later part of the N1 wave was modulated by inhibitory post-synaptic activity, with its peak and the pulse width increasing as inhibition was reduced. These findings suggest that the temporal delay of inhibition with respect to excitation observed in intracellular recordings is also reflected in extracellular field potentials (FPs), resulting in a temporal window during which only excitatory post-synaptic activity and leak channel activity are recorded in the ERP and evoked LFP time series. Based on these findings, we provide clarification on the interpretation of P1 and N1 in terms of the excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic activities of the local pyramidal neural population(s).},

	abstract = {Occipital visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded in response to low-contrast, low spatial-frequency chromatic, and achromatic gratings. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and time-domain analysis were used to reveal differences in harmonic content and amplitude of chromatic and achromatic response components over a wide range of temporal frequencies. The chromatic ON/OFF VEP is dominated by the fundamental component indicating that onset and offset responses are different. This type of response is typical of neurons with sustained type response characteristics. Conversely, the achromatic onset VEP contains a predominant second harmonic component in addition to the fundamental. This similarity between onset and offset responses suggests that transient mechanisms are responsible for the generation of achromatic components. Frequency analysis of VEPs elicited by phase-reversing stimuli reveals that all of the response energy is concentrated at the second harmonic of the stimulating frequency. The magnitude of the second harmonic component is maximal for achromatic stimuli and undergoes a distinct minimum for isoluminant, chromatic stimuli. This behavior indicates that under the stimulus conditions used, magnocellular neurons with transient characteristics dominate the reversal VEP.},

Attempts at objective measurement using monocular probe-detection methods show that sensitivity to probe stimuli is reduced during periods when those stimuli are reportedly suppressed. But are observers really able to detect stimuli that are perceptually invisible, or does the probe presentation itself reverse rivalry dominance between the two eyes? Here, we measured both judgment accuracy and confidence in those judgments across multiple probe contrast levels, and we found evidence for high accuracy with reduced awareness during suppression that was not due to probe-induced switches in rivalry dominance. This dissociation points to the existence of blindsight-like behavior in normal observers. },

@article{Alais2010,
	abstract = {When viewing a different stimulus with each eye, we experience the remarkable phenomenon of binocular rivalry: alternations in consciousness between the stimuli [1, 2]. According to a popular theory first proposed in 1901, neurons encoding the two stimuli engage in reciprocal inhibition [3-8] so that those processing one stimulus inhibit those processing the other, yielding consciousness of one dominant stimulus at any moment and suppressing the other. Also according to the theory, neurons encoding the dominant stimulus adapt, weakening their activity and the inhibition they can exert, whereas neurons encoding the suppressed stimulus recover from adaptation until the balance of activity reverses, triggering an alternation in consciousness. Despite its popularity, this theory has one glaring inconsistency with data: during an episode of suppression, visual sensitivity to brief probe stimuli in the dominant eye should decrease over time and should increase in the suppressed eye, yet sensitivity appears to be constant [9, 10]. Using more appropriate probe stimuli (experiment 1) in conjunction with a new method (experiment 2), we found that sensitivities in dominance and suppression do show the predicted complementary changes.},

@article{Watanabe2004,
	abstract = {Binocular rivalry elevates contrast increment thresholds for the detection of a transient stimulus presented to the suppressed eye, while thresholds measured during dominance are identical to those during monocular viewing (e.g. [Wales, R., & Fox, R. (1970). Increment detection thresholds during binocular rivalry suppression. Perception and Psychophysics, 8, 90-94]). It is well established that contrast increment thresholds depend on reference (pedestal) contrast. With high contrasts, increment thresholds increase with pedestal contrast, reflecting a gain control with sigmoidal non-linearity. We examined how this gain control mechanism operates during binocular rivalry (i.e., with and without perception of a pedestal mask). Subjects viewed a horizontal sine-wave grating (steady pedestal) and a radial checkerboard dichoptically. When the grating achieved a pre-specified phenomenal state (dominance or suppressed), subjects initiated the transient presentation (500-ms Gaussian pulse) of a contrast increment of the same spatial frequency. The pulse appeared in either the upper or lower half of the pedestal. Subjects indicated which half of the pedestal contained the pulse. Contrast increment thresholds were measured using a staircase method with various pedestal contrasts, which yielded threshold versus contrast (TvC) functions during dominance and suppression. The measured thresholds were reliably higher during suppression, but the rising slopes of TvC functions did not differ significantly between dominance and suppression (i.e., constant upward shift of TvC function). A control experiment demonstrated that the TvC function during dominance was identical to that during non-rivalry, monocular viewing. Evidently, the contrast gain control for transient luminance increment does not require the perception of pedestal contrast.},

	abstract = {The brain combines visual information from the two eyes and forms a coherent percept, even when inputs to the eyes are different. However, it is not clear how inputs from the two eyes are combined in visual cortex. We measured fMRI responses to single gratings presented monocularly, or pairs of gratings presented monocularly or dichoptically with several combinations of contrasts. Gratings had either the same orientation or orthogonal orientations (i.e., plaids). Observers performed a demanding task at fixation to minimize top-down modulation of the stimulus-evoked responses. Dichoptic presentation of compatible gratings (same orientation) evoked greater activity than monocular presentation of a single grating only when contrast was low (<10%). A model that assumes linear summation of activity from each eye failed to explain binocular responses at 10% contrast or higher. However, a model with binocular contrast normalization, such that activity from each eye reduced the gain for the other eye, fitted the results very well. Dichoptic presentation of orthogonal gratings evoked greater activity than monocular presentation of a single grating for all contrasts. However, activity evoked by dichoptic plaids was equal to that evoked by monocular plaids. Introducing an onset asynchrony (stimulating one eye 500 ms before the other, which under attentive vision results in flash suppression) had no impact on the results; the responses to dichoptic and monocular plaids were again equal. We conclude that when attention is diverted, inter-ocular suppression in V1 can be explained by a normalization model in which the mutual suppression between orthogonal orientations does not depend on the eye of origin, nor on the onset times, and cross-orientation suppression is weaker than inter-ocular (same orientation) suppression.},

	abstract = {Long-range spatial interactions in human visual cortex were explored using a lateral masking paradigm. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) elicited by a Gabor signal presented in isolation or in the presence of two flanking high-contrast Gabor signals (masks) were measured. Response amplitude and phase were recorded for a vertically oriented test, for horizontal and vertical masks and for combinations of vertical tests and vertical or horizontal masks. The amplitudes and phases of the test alone and mask alone responses were added coherently to predict the amplitude for collinear and orthogonal lateral masking conditions. Additivity failures were taken as evidence for neural interactions. At a target-to-mask distance of 2 deg, VEP amplitude exceeded the linear prediction for test contrasts in the range of 8-16% for the collinear, co-axial target/mask combination. Measured response phase also led predicted response phase over the same range of contrast. The VEP amplitudes were less than the linear prediction in the orthogonal target/mask combination and measured response phase lagged the predicted phase. Significant facilitation occurred with collinear test/mask combinations up to at least 3 deg of separation (nine wavelengths). Co-oriented, but non-collinear test/mask combinations (oblique test and mask, horizontal test and mask) did not produce facilitation. Contrast gain thus appears to be set over considerable distances in a configuration-specific fashion.},

@article{Bonds1989,
	abstract = {Mechanisms supporting orientation selectivity of cat striate cortical cells were studied by stimulation with two superimposed sine-wave gratings of different orientations. One grating (base) generated a discharge of known amplitude which could be modified by the second grating (mask). Masks presented at nonoptimal orientations usually reduced the base-generated response, but the degree of reduction varied widely between cells. Cells with narrow orientation tuning tended to be more susceptible to mask presence than broadly tuned cells; similarly, simple cells generally showed more response reduction than did complex cells. The base and mask stimuli were drifted at different temporal frequencies which, in simple cells, permitted the identification of individual response components from each stimulus. This revealed that the reduction of the base response by the mask usually did not vary regularly with mask orientation, although response facilitation from the mask was orientation selective. In some sharply tuned simple cells, response reduction had clear local maxima near the limits of the cell's orientation-tuning function. Response reduction resulted from a nearly pure rightward shift of the response versus log contrast function. The lowest mask contrast yielding reduction was within 0.1-0.3 log unit of the lowest contrast effective for excitation. The temporal-frequency bandpass of the response-reduction mechanism resembled that of most cortical cells. The spatial-frequency bandpass was much broader than is typical for single cortical cells, spanning essentially the entire visual range of the cat. These findings are compatible with a model in which weak intrinsic orientation-selective excitation is enhanced in two stages: (1) control of threshold by nonorientation-selective inhibition that is continuously dependent on stimulus contrast; and (2) in the more narrowly tuned cells, orientation-selective inhibition that has local maxima serving to increase the slope of the orientation-tuning function.},

@article{Sengpiel1998,
	abstract = {Recently, it has been proposed that all suppressive phenomena observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) are mediated by a single mechanism, involving inhibition by pools of neurons, which, between them, represent a wide range of stimulus specificities. The strength of such inhibition would depend on the stimulus that produces it (particularly its contrast) rather than on the firing rate of the inhibited cell. We tested this hypothesis by measuring contrast-response functions (CRFs) of neurons in cat V1 for stimulation of the classical receptive field of the dominant eye with an optimal grating alone, and in the presence of inhibition caused by (1) a superimposed orthogonal grating (cross-orientation inhibition); (2) a surrounding iso-oriented grating (surround inhibition); and (3) an orthogonal grating in the other eye (interocular suppression). We fitted hyperbolic ratio functions and found that the effect of cross-orientation inhibition was best described as a rightward shift of the CRF ('contrast-gain control'), while surround inhibition and interocular suppression were primarily characterised as downward shifts of the CRF ('response-gain control'). However, the latter also showed a component of contrast-gain control. The two modes of suppression were differently distributed between the layers of cortex. Response-gain control prevailed in layer 4, whereas cells in layers 2/3, 5 and 6 mainly showed contrast-gain control. As in human observers, surround gratings caused suppression when the central grating was of high contrast, but in over a third of the cells tested, enhanced responses for low-contrast central stimuli, hence actually decreasing threshold contrast.},

After the ISI, brief test flashes are presented to both eyes simultaneously. For ISIs less than 100-200 msec, only the test flash contralateral to the stimulated eye is seen. The test flash in the ipsilateral eye is not seen. For ISIs of 200-1000 msec, the contralateral test flash is seen more clearly and completely than the ipsilateral flash (Experiments 1 and 2). The initial and ipsilateral test flash need not be spatially similar. The initial stimulus can be dim but must be longer than 150 msec (Experiment 3). Experiment 3 precludes forward masking or light adaptation as explanation. The effect is relatively independent of the length of the test flash (Experiment 4). The results can be explained in terms of the known properties of binocular rivalry and reinforce the hypothesis (Fox and Check, 1968) that rivalry acts nonselectively, independent of factors such as spatial frequency, luminance, or orientation.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the cat primary visual cortex are selective for particular contour orientations but their responsiveness can vary under certain conditions. After prolonged stimulation (adaptation), the contrast sensitivity of cortical cells is reduced and the 'gain' (the strength of response as a function of contrast) falls. The response to an optimal contour is also reduced when a different stimulus is superimposed on the receptive field in the same eye. Here we report that the sudden appearance of an inappropriate stimulus in one eye can interocularly suppress the activity of cortical neurons if they are already responding to an optimally oriented stimulus in the other eye. In strabismic cats, whose cortical neurons lack binocular facilitation, even contours of similar orientation shown to the two eyes trigger such suppression. This interocular control of cortical responsiveness could serve to veto signals from one eye under conditions that would otherwise cause double vision and perceptual confusion.},

	abstract = {The response of a neuron in striate cortex to an optimally oriented stimulus is suppressed by a superimposed orthogonal stimulus. The neural mechanism underlying this cross-orientation suppression (COS) may arise from intracortical or subcortical processes or from both. Recent studies of the temporal frequency and adaptation properties of COS suggest that depression at thalamo-cortical synapses may be the principal mechanism. To examine the possible role of synaptic depression in relation to COS, we measured the recovery time course of COS. We find it too rapid to be explained by synaptic depression. We also studied potential subcortical processes by measuring single cell contrast response functions for a population of LGN neurons. In general, contrast saturation is a consistent property of LGN neurons. Combined with rectifying nonlinearities in the LGN and spike threshold nonlinearities in visual cortex, contrast saturation in the LGN can account for most of the COS that is observed in the visual cortex.},

Current and conductance are decoupled (by a complementary arrangement of excitation and inhibition) so that current depends only on the LGN inputs and conductance depends only on the cortical inputs.

@article{Tolhurst1997,
	abstract = {In almost every study of the linearity of spatiotemporal summation in simple cells of the cat's visual cortex, there have been systematic mismatches between the experimental observations and the predictions of the linear theory. These mismatches have generally been explained by supposing that the initial spatiotemporal summation stage is strictly linear, but that the following output stage of the simple cell is subject to some contrast-dependent nonlinearity. Two main models of the output nonlinearity have been proposed: the threshold model (e.g. Tolhurst & Dean, 1987) and the contrast-normalization model (e.g. Heeger, 1992a,b). In this paper, the two models are fitted rigorously to a variety of previously published neurophysiological data, in order to determine whether one model is a better explanation of the data. We reexamine data on the interaction between two bar stimuli presented in different parts of the receptive field; on the relationship between the receptive-field map and the inverse Fourier transform of the spatial-frequency tuning curve; on the dependence of response amplitude and phase on the spatial phase of stationary gratings; on the relationships between the responses to moving and modulated gratings; and on the suppressive action of gratings moving in a neuron's nonpreferred direction. In many situations, the predictions of the two models are similar, but the contrast-normalization model usually fits the data slightly better than the threshold model, and it is easier to apply the equations of the normalization model. More importantly, the normalization model is naturally able to account very well for the details and subtlety of the results in experiments where the total contrast energy of the stimuli changes; some of these phenomena are completely beyond the scope of the threshold model. Rigorous application of the models' equations has revealed some situations where neither model fits quite well enough, and we must suppose, therefore, that there are some subtle nonlinearities still to be characterized.},

In the foveal retina we found that the perceived contrast of the central pattern was reduced by the presence of the contrast surrounds with the effect being greatest at low test contrast. Detection thresholds were not affected and contrast discrimination thresholds were only affected over a small range of low test contrasts. However if the test pattern was made smaller, or if its central part was occluded detection thresholds were raised. In the peripheral retina detection thresholds were raised and discrimination thresholds were affected over most of the range of contrasts. We argue that the pattern of results resembles those produced in masking paradigms where the test and mask are coextensive if the spatial range of interactions is taken into account and hence the effects of the contrast surround may be merely a manifestation of normal masking processes.},

@article{Lu1998,
	abstract = {We developed and tested a powerful method for identifying and characterizing the effect of attention on performance in visual tasks as due to signal enhancement, distractor exclusion, or internal noise suppression. Based on a noisy Perceptual Template Model (PTM) of a human observer, the method adds increasing amounts of external noise (white gaussian random noise) to the visual stimulus and observes the effect on performance of a perceptual task for attended and unattended stimuli. The three mechanisms of attention yield three "signature" patterns of performance. The general framework for characterizing the mechanisms of attention is used here to investigate the attentional mechanisms in a concurrent location-cued orientation discrimination task. Test stimuli--Gabor patches tilted slightly to the right or left--always appeared on both the left and the right of fixation, and varied independently. Observers were cued on each trial to attend to the left, the right, or evenly to both stimuli, and decide the direction of tilt of both test stimuli. For eight levels of added external noise and three attention conditions (attended, unattended, and equal), subjects' contrast threshold levels were determined. At low levels of external noise, attention affected threshold contrast: threshold contrasts for non-attended stimuli were systematically higher than for equal attention stimuli, which were, in turn, higher than for attended stimuli. Specifically, when the rms contrast of the external noise is below 10%, there is a consistent 17% elevation of contrast threshold from attended to unattended condition across all three subjects. For higher levels of external noise, attention conditions did not affect threshold contrast values at all. These strong results are characteristic of a signal enhancement, or equivalently, an internal additive noise reduction mechanism of attention.},

Different spatial configurations of the surround stimuli were studied. Our results confirmed previous findings that (1) a surround stimulus could produce either contrast enhancement or contrast suppression depending on the balance of the central and surround contrasts; (2) suppression varied with the width of the surround stimulus and was strongly orientation-specific; and (3) enhancement was less sensitive to changes in surround configurations (in particular, enhancement did not depend on the colinearity of the central and surround gratings).

A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in which the responses of neurons are divided by a common factor that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons. Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Several recent studies have demonstrated that following short-term monocular deprivation in normal adults, the patched eye, rather than the unpatched eye, becomes stronger in subsequent binocular viewing. However, little is known about the site and nature of the underlying processes. In this study, we examine the underlying mechanisms by measuring steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as an index of the neural contrast response in early visual areas.
METHODS: The experiment consisted of three consecutive stages: a pre-patching EEG recording (14 minutes), a monocular patching stage (2.5 hours) and a post-patching EEG recording (14 minutes; started immediately after the removal of the patch). During the patching stage, a diffuser (transmits light but not pattern) was placed in front of one randomly selected eye. During the EEG recording stage, contrast response functions for each eye were measured.
RESULTS: The neural responses from the patched eye increased after the removal of the patch, whilst the responses from the unpatched eye remained the same. Such phenomena occurred under both monocular and dichoptic viewing conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: We interpret this eye dominance plasticity in adult human visual cortex as homeostatic intrinsic plasticity regulated by an increase of contrast-gain in the patched eye.},

Our aim was to develop an objective electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm that can be used to provide a clinically useful index of amblyopic deficits.
METHODS: We used steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to measure full contrast response functions in both amblyopic (n = 10, strabismic or mixed amblyopia, mean age: 44 years) and control (n = 5, mean age: 31 years) observers, both with and without a dichoptic mask.
RESULTS: At the highest target contrast, the ratio of amplitudes across the weaker and stronger eyes was highly correlated (r = 0.76) with the acuity ratio between the eyes. We also found that the contrast response function in the amblyopic eye had both a greatly reduced amplitude and a shallower slope, but that surprisingly dichoptic masking was weaker than in controls. The results were compared with the predictions of a computational model of amblyopia and suggest a modification to the model whereby excitatory (but not suppressive) signals are attenuated in the amblyopic eye.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that SSVEPs offer a sensitive and objective measure of the ocular imbalance in amblyopia and could be used to assess the efficacy of amblyopia therapies currently under development.},

Here we investigated whether dietary intervention aimed at increasing levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can influence neural responses to basic sensory stimuli. Using a steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm, we found that the neural response to visual patterns was reduced in individuals who consumed a yeast extract product rich in substances associated with the production of GABA (glutamate and B vitamins), but not in a control group who consumed a placebo substance ( n = 14 per group). This demonstrates that the balance of excitation and inhibition in the brain can be influenced by dietary interventions, suggesting possible clinical benefits in conditions (e.g. epilepsy) where inhibition is abnormal.},

@article{Vanegas2019,
	abstract = {Over the last decades, psychophysical and electrophysiological studies in patients and animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD), have consistently revealed a number of visual abnormalities. In particular, specific alterations of contrast sensitivity curves, electroretinogram (ERG), and visual-evoked potentials (VEP), have been attributed to dopaminergic retinal depletion. However, fundamental mechanisms of cortical visual processing, such as normalization or "gain control" computations, have not yet been examined in PD patients. Here, we measured electrophysiological indices of gain control in both space (surround suppression) and time (sensory adaptation) in PD patients based on steady-state VEP (ssVEP). Compared with controls, patients exhibited a significantly higher initial ssVEP amplitude that quickly decayed over time, and greater relative suppression of ssVEP amplitude as a function of surrounding stimulus contrast. Meanwhile, EEG frequency spectra were broadly elevated in patients relative to controls. Thus, contrary to what might be expected given the reduced contrast sensitivity often reported in PD, visual neural responses are not weaker; rather, they are initially larger but undergo an exaggerated degree of spatial and temporal gain control and are embedded within a greater background noise level. These differences may reflect cortical mechanisms that compensate for dysfunctional center-surround interactions at the retinal level.},

	abstract = {During binocular viewing, visual inputs from the two eyes interact at the level of visual cortex. Here we studied binocular interactions in human visual cortex, including both sexes, using source-imaged steady-state visual evoked potentials over a wide range of relative contrast between two eyes. The ROIs included areas V1, V3a, hV4, hMT+, and lateral occipital cortex. Dichoptic parallel grating stimuli in each eye modulated at distinct temporal frequencies allowed us to quantify spectral components associated with the individual stimuli from monocular inputs (self-terms) and responses due to interaction between the inputs from the two eyes (intermodulation [IM] terms). Data with self-terms revealed an interocular suppression effect, in which the responses to the stimulus in one eye were reduced when a stimulus was presented simultaneously to the other eye. The suppression magnitude varied depending on visual area, and the relative contrast between the two eyes. Suppression was strongest in V1 and V3a (50% reduction) and was least in lateral occipital cortex (20% reduction). Data with IM terms revealed another form of binocular interaction, compared with self-terms. IM response was strongest at V1 and was least in hV4. Fits of a family of divisive gain control models to both self- and IM-term responses within each cortical area indicated that both forms of binocular interaction shared a common gain control nonlinearity. However, our model fits revealed different patterns of binocular interaction along the cortical hierarchy, particularly in terms of excitatory and suppressive contributions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Using source-imaged steady-state visual evoked potentials and frequency-domain analysis of dichoptic stimuli, we measured two forms of binocular interactions: one is associated with the individual stimuli that represent interocular suppression from each eye, and the other is a direct measure of interocular interaction between inputs from the two eyes. We demonstrated that both forms of binocular interactions share a common gain control mechanism in striate and extra-striate cortex. Furthermore, our model fits revealed different patterns of binocular interaction along the visual cortical hierarchy, particularly in terms of excitatory and suppressive contributions.},

	abstract = {After a preliminary study of visual evoked potentials (VEPS) to a test grating seen in the presence of masks at different orientations, psychophysical data are presented showing the effects of adaptation and of masking on thresholds for detecting the same test grating. The test is a vertical grating of spatial frequency 2 cycles per degree; adapting and masking gratings differ from the test either in orientation or in spatial frequency. The effects of adaptation and masking are explained by a single mechanism model that assumes: (i) adaptation and masking both alter the contrast response (or transducer) function of the mechanism that detects the test; (ii) masks, but not adaptors, stimulate the mechanism that detects the test; and (iii) a test is detectable when it raises response level by a constant amount. The model incorporates two distinct tuning functions, a broad adaptive contrast function and a narrow effective contrast function. It accounts adequately for all the data, including the location and size of the facilitative dip found in some masking functions, the constant slopes of the threshold elevation segments of adaptation functions and the varying slopes of masking functions. It also predicts the sometimes surprising joint effects of adaptation followed by masking and of two masks operating simultaneously.},

Here the development of orientation processing is further examined using a visual-evoked potential paradigm and normalization models of pattern masking. Contrast response functions were measured for 1 cycle per degree (cpd) gratings, counterphase-reversed in contrast at either 3.3 or 5.5 Hz. A second 1 cpd, 20% contrast, 8.3 Hz grating of either the same or orthogonal orientation was added as a mask. Evoked responses associated with the test grating, the mask, and intermodulation between the two were individually extracted using spectral analysis of the scalp-recorded EEG. Adults exhibited orientation selectivity in the masking of their test component responses and in nonlinear intermodulation between the test and mask stimuli. Infants <5 months old, however, demonstrated nonselective masking or a reversed selectivity in their responses to the test component, with adult-like orientation selectivity in their intermodulation responses. Within the context of a normalization model of pattern masking, the results are consistent with the existence of oriented filters early in life the responses of which are normalized immaturely until approximately 5 months of age.},

	abstract = {1. Visual evoked potentials (v.e.p.s) were recorded from human adults to investigate orientation-specific neural interactions. The stimuli were the sum of two gratings, sinusoidally modulated in space and time at different frequencies. Recordings were made for one grating (test) alone, and with another superimposed grating (mask), oriented parallel or orthogonal to the test. The amplitude and phase of the v.e.p.s at twice the test modulation frequency (second harmonic) was measured as a function of test contrast to produce contrast-response curves. 2. Orthogonal masks attenuated considerably the amplitude of v.e.p.s. The attenuation at any given contrast was approximately proportional, or multiplicative, lowering the slope of the contrast-response curve, without affecting significantly the extrapolated threshold. Parallel masks also attenuated v.e.p. amplitudes but in a different way, leaving the slope of the contrast-response curves unchanged, while elevating threshold. 3. The attenuation by orthogonal masks occurred over a wide range of test spatial frequencies, from 0.8 to 8 cycles/deg. For any given test spatial frequency, the most effective masks were those of spatial frequency similar to or lower than the test. Masks of spatial frequency 1.5 octaves higher than the test did not attenuate v.e.p. amplitudes. 4. The mask temporal frequency for maximal attenuation of v.e.p. amplitude was around 12 Hz, with stationary masks having little effect. 5. Under most conditions, the phase of the second harmonic of the v.e.p., increased with increasing contrast (phase advance). Superimposition of a parallel mask abolished phase advance, while orthogonal masks increased it. 6. Comparisons with single cortical unit and evoked potential recordings in cats suggest that the attenuation by orthogonal masks reflects intracortical inhibitory interactions between cell populations of different orientation preference.},

	abstract = {Gain modulation of neuronal responses is widely observed in the cerebral cortex of both anesthetized and behaving animals. Does this multiplicative effect on neuronal tuning curves require underlying multiplicative mechanisms of integration? We compare the effects of a divisive mechanism of inhibition (noisy excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs) with the effects of two subtractive mechanisms (shunting conductance and hyperpolarizing current) on the tuning curves of a model cortical neuron. We find that, although the effects of subtractive inhibition can appear nonlinear, they are accompanied by a change in response threshold and are best described as a vertical shift along the response axis. Increasing noisy synaptic activity divisively scales the model responses, reproducing a response-gain control effect. When mutual inhibition between subpopulations of local neurons is included, the model exhibits a gain modulation effect that is better described as input-gain control. We apply these findings to experimental data by examining how noisy synaptic input may underlie divisive surround suppression and attention-driven gain modulation of neuronal responses in the visual system.},

	abstract = {Interocular interaction in the visual system occurs under dichoptic conditions when contrast and luminance are imbalanced between the eyes. Human psychophysical investigations suggest that interocular interaction can be explained by a contrast normalization model. However, the neural processes that underlie such interactions are still unresolved. We set out to assess, for the first time, the proposed normalization model of interocular contrast interactions using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and to extend this model to incorporate interactions based on interocular luminance differences. We used MEG to record steady-state visual evoked responses (SSVER), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to obtain individual retinotopic maps that we used in combination with MEG source imaging in healthy participants. Binary noise stimuli were presented in monocular or dichoptic viewing and were frequency-tagged at 4 and 6 Hz. The contrast of the stimuli was modulated in a range between 0 and 32%. Monocularly, we reduced the luminance by placing a 1.5 ND filter over one eye in the maximal contrast condition. This ND filter reduces the mean light level by a factor of 30 without any alteration to the physical contrast. We observed in visual area V1 a monotonic increase in the magnitude of SSVERs with changes in contrast from 0 to 32%. For both eyes, dichoptic masking induced a decrease in SSVER signal power. This power decrease was well explained by the normalization model. Reducing mean luminance delayed monocular processing by approximately 38 ms in V1. The reduced luminance also decreased the masking ability of the eye under the filter. Predictions based on a temporal filtering model for the interocular luminance difference prior to the model's binocular combination stage were incorporated to update the normalization model. Our results demonstrate that the signals resulting from different contrast or luminance stimulation of the two eyes are combined in a way that can be explained by an interocular normalization model.},

	abstract = {Surround suppression is a well-known example of contextual interaction in visual cortical neurophysiology, whereby the neural response to a stimulus presented within a neuron's classical receptive field is suppressed by surrounding stimuli. Human psychophysical reports present an obvious analog to the effects seen at the single-neuron level: stimuli are perceived as lower-contrast when embedded in a surround. Here we report on a visual paradigm that provides relatively direct, straightforward indices of surround suppression in human electrophysiology, enabling us to reproduce several well-known neurophysiological and psychophysical effects, and to conduct new analyses of temporal trends and retinal location effects. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) elicited by flickering "foreground" stimuli were measured in the context of various static surround patterns. Early visual cortex geometry and retinotopic organization were exploited to enhance SSVEP amplitude. The foreground response was strongly suppressed as a monotonic function of surround contrast. Furthermore, suppression was stronger for surrounds of matching orientation than orthogonally-oriented ones, and stronger at peripheral than foveal locations. These patterns were reproduced in psychophysical reports of perceived contrast, and peripheral electrophysiological suppression effects correlated with psychophysical effects across subjects. Temporal analysis of SSVEP amplitude revealed short-term contrast adaptation effects that caused the foreground signal to either fall or grow over time, depending on the relative contrast of the surround, consistent with stronger adaptation of the suppressive drive. This electrophysiology paradigm has clinical potential in indexing not just visual deficits but possibly gain control deficits expressed more widely in the disordered brain. },

In the present study, we show that a similar suppressive effect occurs for visually evoked magnetic responses in the human visual cortex. The initial peak amplitude of the magnetic response (at a latency of around 90 ms) to a test grating accompanied by high-contrast surround gratings was smaller than that for the test without the surround. Current source localization with a single dipole model indicated that the initial response originated from cortical activity near the occipital pole in the contralateral hemisphere to the visual stimulation. The peak amplitude for the test decreased with increasing surround contrast, and increased with increasing test contrast. The contrast dependence and the early development of the surround suppression were in agreement with the results of the V1 single-cell studies of monkeys and cats. We suggest that the surround suppression of the initial peak amplitude of the magnetic response may be ascribed to the inhibition of the neural activity at the early processing stage(s), presumably at V1, in the human visual cortex.},

Observers performed a contrast discrimination task on a contrast-reversing sinusoidal target grating. The target was either presented in isolation or embedded in a high-contrast surround. While observers performed the task, we also measured fMRI responses as a function of target contrast, both with and without a surround. We found that the surround substantially increased the psychophysical thresholds while reducing fMRI responses. The two data sets were compared, on the basis of the assumption that a fixed response difference is required for correct discrimination, and we found that the psychophysics accounted for 96.5% of the variance in the measured V1 responses. The suppression in visual areas V2 and V3 was stronger, too strong to agree with psychophysics. The good quantitative agreement between psychophysical thresholds and V1 responses suggests V1 as a plausible candidate for mediating surround masking.},

Adaptation to visual motion has strong perceptual effects, so we studied the effect of prolonged stimulation on neuronal responsivity in the macaque's area MT, a cortical area whose importance to visual motion perception is well established. We adapted MT neurons with sinusoidal gratings drifting in the preferred or null direction. Preferred adaptation reduced the responsiveness of MT cells, primarily by changing their contrast gain, and this effect was spatially specific within the receptive field. Null adaptation reduced the ability of null gratings to inhibit the response to a simultaneously presented preferred stimulus. While both preferred and null adaptation alter MT responses, these effects probably do not occur in MT neurons but are likely to reflect adaptation-induced changes in contrast gain earlier in the visual pathway.},

@article{Albrecht1984,
	abstract = {Spatial contrast adaptation, produced by prolonged exposure to high contrast grating patterns, has become an important psychophysical method for isolating spatial and orientation selective channels in the human visual system. It has been reasonably argued that this adaptation may be fundamentally dependent upon the activity of neurones in the striate cortex. To test the validity of this hypothesis, and several others, we measured the general adaptation characteristics of 144 striate neurones using a stimulus protocol comparable to the typical psychophysical methods. In general, during prolonged high contrast stimulation, the responses of most cells exponentially decayed from a transient peak response to a sustained plateau response; following adaptation, the responses to lower contrasts were depressed relative to the unadapted state but then gradually recovered from the transient depression to a sustained plateau. Such adaptation was a property common to both simple and complex cells (the distributions of the quantitative of adaptation were overlapping); there were however small but reliable differences. We compared the neurophysiological contrast adaptation with two psychophysical estimates of human contrast adaptation (threshold contrast elevation and apparent contrast reduction) and found that the time courses and the magnitudes were quite similar. The effect of contrast adaptation on the spatial frequency tuning was assessed by measuring the contrast response function at several different test spatial frequencies before and after adaptation at the optimum centre frequency. We found that the effect of adaptation decreased as the difference between test and adaptation frequency increased. Grating contrast adaptation has been alternatively described as 'constructive gain control' on the one hand and as 'deleterious fatigue' on the other. We tested the effect of contrast adaptation on the contrast response function and found (a) that adaptation shifts the curves vertically downward parallel to the response axis (thus reflecting a decrease in the maximum rate of firing and a deleterious compression of the response range) and (b) that adaptation shifts the curves horizontally to the right parallel to the contrast axis (thus reflecting a true sensitivity shift of the remaining response range for constructive maintenance of high differential sensitivity around the prevailing background level).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{Ledgeway2005,
	abstract = {Cortical neurons selective for the direction of motion often exhibit some limited response to motion in their nonpreferred directions. Here we examine the dependence of neuronal direction selectivity on stimulus contrast, both for first-order (luminance-modulated, sine-wave grating) and second-order (contrast-modulated envelope) stimuli. We measured responses from single neurons in area 18 of cat visual cortex to both kinds of moving stimuli over a wide range of contrasts (1.25-80%). Direction-selective contrast response functions (CRFs) were calculated as the preferred-minus-null difference in average firing frequency as a function of contrast. We also applied receiver operating characteristic analysis to our CRF data to obtain neurometric functions characterizing the potential ability of each neuron to discriminate motion direction at each contrast level tested. CRFs for sine-wave gratings were usually monotonic; however, a substantial minority of neurons (35%) exhibited nonmonotonic CRFs (such that the degree of direction selectivity decreased with increasing contrast). The underlying preferred and nonpreferred direction CRFs were diverse, often having different shapes in a given neuron. Neurometric functions for direction discrimination showed a similar degree of heterogeneity, including instances of nonmonotonicity. For contrast-modulated stimuli, however, CRFs for either carrier or envelope contrast were always monotonic. In a given neuron, neurometric thresholds were typically much higher for second- than for first-order stimuli. These results demonstrate that the degree of a cell's direction selectivity depends on the contrast at which it is measured, and therefore is not a characteristic parameter of a neuron. In general, contrast response functions for first-order stimuli were very heterogeneous in shape and sensitivity, while those for second-order stimuli showed less sensitivity and were quite stereotyped in shape.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) are two noninvasive methods commonly used to study neural mechanisms supporting visual attention in humans. Studies using these tools, which have complementary spatial and temporal resolutions, implicitly assume they index similar underlying neural modulations related to external stimulus and internal attentional manipulations. Accordingly, they are often used interchangeably for constraining understanding about the impact of bottom-up and top-down factors on neural modulations. To test this core assumption, we simultaneously manipulated bottom-up sensory inputs by varying stimulus contrast and top-down cognitive modulations by changing the focus of spatial attention. Each of the male and female subjects participated in both fMRI and EEG sessions performing the same experimental paradigm. We found categorically different patterns of attentional modulation on fMRI activity in early visual cortex and early stimulus-evoked potentials measured via EEG (e.g., the P1 component and steady-state visually-evoked potentials): fMRI activation scaled additively with attention, whereas evoked EEG components scaled multiplicatively with attention. However, across longer time scales, a contralateral negative-going potential and oscillatory EEG signals in the alpha band revealed additive attentional modulation patterns like those observed with fMRI. These results challenge prior assumptions that fMRI and early stimulus-evoked potentials measured with EEG can be interchangeably used to index the same neural mechanisms of attentional modulations at different spatiotemporal scales. Instead, fMRI measures of attentional modulations are more closely linked with later EEG components and alpha-band oscillations. Considered together, hemodynamic and electrophysiological signals can jointly constrain understanding of the neural mechanisms supporting cognition.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT fMRI and EEG have been used as tools to measure the location and timing of attentional modulations in visual cortex and are often used interchangeably for constraining computational models under the assumption that they index similar underlying neural processes. However, by varying attentional and stimulus parameters, we found differential patterns of attentional modulations of fMRI activity in early visual cortex and commonly used stimulus-evoked potentials measured via EEG. Instead, across longer time scales, a contralateral negative-going potential and EEG oscillations in the alpha band exhibited attentional modulations similar to those observed with fMRI. Together, these results suggest that different physiological processes assayed by these complementary techniques must be jointly considered when making inferences about the neural underpinnings of cognitive operations.},

We tested several computational models against data from steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) experiments in humans, using periodic visual stimuli combined across either retinal location or eye-of-presentation. A model in which signals are raised to an exponent before being summed in both the numerator and the denominator of a gain control nonlinearity gave the best account of the data. This model also predicted the pattern of responses in a range of additional conditions accurately and with no free parameters, as well as predicting responses at harmonic and intermodulation frequencies between 1 and 30 Hz. We speculate that this model implements the optimal algorithm for combining multiple noisy inputs, in which responses are proportional to the weighted sum of both inputs. This suggests a novel purpose for cortical gain control: implementing optimal signal combination via mutual inhibition, perhaps explaining its ubiquity as a neural computation.},

Population responses to two superimposed gratings were weighted sums of the individual grating responses. The weights depended strongly on the relative contrasts of the gratings. When the contrasts were similar, the population performed an approximately equal summation. When the contrasts differed markedly, however, the population performed approximately a winner-take-all competition. Stimuli that were intermediate to these extremes elicited intermediate responses. This entire range of behaviors was explained by a single model of contrast normalization. Normalization captured both the spike responses and the local field potential responses; it even predicted visually evoked currents source-localized to V1 in human subjects. Normalization has profound effects on V1 population responses and is likely to shape the interpretation of these responses by higher cortical areas.},

	abstract = {White pixel noise is widely used to estimate the level of internal noise in a system by injecting external variance into the detecting mechanism. Recent work (Baker and Meese, 2012) has provided psychophysical evidence that such noise masks might also cause suppression that could invalidate estimates of internal noise. Here we measure neural population responses directly, using steady-state visual evoked potentials, elicited by target stimuli embedded in different mask types. Sinusoidal target gratings of 1 c/deg flickered at 5 Hz, and were shown in isolation, or with superimposed orthogonal grating masks or 2D white noise masks, flickering at 7 Hz. Compared with responses to a blank screen, the Fourier amplitude at the target frequency increased monotonically as a function of target contrast when no mask was present. Both orthogonal and white noise masks caused rightward shifts of the contrast response function, providing evidence of contrast gain control suppression. We also calculated within-observer amplitude variance across trials. This increased in proportion to the target response, implying signal-dependent (i.e., multiplicative) noise at the system level, the implications of which we discuss for behavioral tasks. This measure of variance was reduced by both mask types, consistent with the changes in mean target response. An alternative variety of noise, which we term zero-dimensional noise, involves trial-by-trial jittering of the target contrast. This type of noise produced no gain control suppression, and increased the amplitude variance across trials. },

	abstract = {Cortical responses to spatially discrete patches of achromatic luminance contrast can be altered by the presence of high-contrast, spatially remote "surrounds" and this achromatic "surround suppression" has been the subject of much recent research. However, the nature of long-range contrast normalization in chromatic signals has been less studied. Here we use a combination of neuroimaging data from source-imaged EEG and two different psychophysical measures of surround suppression to study contrast normalization in stimuli containing achromatic luminance and S-cone-isolating contrast. In an appearance matching task, we find strong within-channel but little between-channel suppression. However, using a contrast increment detection task, we do find evidence for weak but significant between-channel effects. Our neural measurements agree with the appearance matching data, showing significant within-channel suppression and no significant interactions between signals initiated in different pre-cortical pathways. We hypothesize that appearance judgments and V1 population responses are dominated by neurons with chromatically matched classical and extra-classical surrounds while contrast increment detection tasks rely on a subpopulation of neurons that have extra-classical surrounds sensitive to both chromatic and achromatic contrasts. Our psychophysical and source-imaged EEG results are consistent with a hypothesis based on natural scene statistics that long-range contrast normalization in early visual system is largely driven by signals within the same chromatic channel.},

	abstract = {Stimulus visibility can be reduced by other stimuli that overlap the same region of visual space, a process known as masking. Here we studied the neural mechanisms of masking in humans using source-imaged steady state visual evoked potentials and frequency-domain analysis over a wide range of relative stimulus strengths of test and mask stimuli. Test and mask stimuli were tagged with distinct temporal frequencies and we quantified spectral response components associated with the individual stimuli (self terms) and responses due to interaction between stimuli (intermodulation terms). In early visual cortex, masking alters the self terms in a manner consistent with a reduction of input contrast. We also identify a novel signature of masking: a robust intermodulation term that peaks when the test and mask stimuli have equal contrast and disappears when they are widely different. We fit all of our data simultaneously with family of a divisive gain control models that differed only in their dynamics. Models with either very short or very long temporal integration constants for the gain pool performed worse than a model with an integration time of ∼30 ms. Finally, the absolute magnitudes of the response were controlled by the ratio of the stimulus contrasts, not their absolute values. This contrast-contrast invariance suggests that many neurons in early visual cortex code relative rather than absolute contrast. Together, these results provide a more complete description of masking within the normalization framework of contrast gain control and suggest that contrast normalization accomplishes multiple functional goals.},

	abstract = {Early psychological researchers proposed a link between intelligence and low-level perceptual performance. It was recently suggested that this link is driven by individual variations in the ability to suppress irrelevant information, evidenced by the observation of strong correlations between perceptual surround suppression and cognitive performance. However, the neural mechanisms underlying such a link remain unclear. A candidate mechanism is neural inhibition by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but direct experimental support for GABA-mediated inhibition underlying suppression is inconsistent. Here we report evidence consistent with a global suppressive mechanism involving GABA underlying the link between sensory performance and intelligence. We measured visual cortical GABA concentration, visuo-spatial intelligence and visual surround suppression in a group of healthy adults. Levels of GABA were strongly predictive of both intelligence and surround suppression, with higher levels of intelligence associated with higher levels of GABA and stronger surround suppression. These results indicate that GABA-mediated neural inhibition may be a key factor determining cognitive performance and suggests a physiological mechanism linking surround suppression and intelligence. },

	abstract = {Gain control is a salient feature of information processing throughout the visual system. Heeger (1991, 1992) described a mechanism that could underpin gain control in primary visual cortex (V1). According to this model, a neuron's response is normalized by dividing its output by the sum of a population of neurons, which are selective for orientations covering a broad range. Gain control in this scheme is manifested as a change in the semisaturation constant (contrast gain) of a V1 neuron. Here we examine how flanking and annular gratings of the same or orthogonal orientation to that preferred by a neuron presented beyond the receptive field modulate gain in V1 neurons in anesthetized marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). To characterize how gain was modulated by surround stimuli, the Michaelis-Menten equation was fitted to response versus contrast functions obtained under each stimulus condition. The modulation of gain by surround stimuli was modelled best as a divisive reduction in response gain. Response gain varied with the orientation of surround stimuli, but was reduced most when the orientation of a large annular grating beyond the classical receptive field matched the preferred orientation of neurons. The strength of surround suppression did not vary significantly with retinal eccentricity or laminar distribution. In the marmoset, as in macaques (Angelucci et al., 2002a,b), gain control over the sort of distances reported here (up to 10 deg) may be mediated by feedback from extrastriate areas.},

	abstract = {Feedback connections are prevalent throughout the cerebral cortex, yet their function remains poorly understood. Previous studies in anesthetized monkeys found that inactivating feedback from extrastriate visual cortex produced effects in striate cortex that were relatively weak, generally suppressive, largest for visual stimuli confined to the receptive field center, and detectable only at low stimulus contrast. We studied the influence of corticocortical feedback in alert monkeys using cortical cooling to reversibly inactivate visual areas 2 (V2) and 3 (V3) while characterizing receptive field properties in primary visual cortex (V1). We show that inactivation of feedback from areas V2 and V3 results in both response suppression and facilitation for stimuli restricted to the receptive field center, in most cases leading to a small reduction in the degree of orientation selectivity but no change in orientation preference. For larger-diameter stimuli that engage regions beyond the center of the receptive field, eliminating feedback from V2 and V3 results in strong and consistent response facilitation, effectively reducing the strength of surround suppression in V1 for stimuli of both low and high contrast. For extended contours, eliminating feedback had the effect of reducing end stopping. Inactivation effects were largest for neurons that exhibited strong surround suppression before inactivation, and their timing matched the dynamics of surround suppression under control conditions.

@article{Freeman2002,
	abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are thought to receive inhibition from other V1 neurons selective for a variety of orientations. Evidence for this inhibition is commonly found in cross-orientation suppression: responses of a V1 neuron to optimally oriented bars are suppressed by superimposed mask bars of different orientation. We show, however, that suppression is unlikely to result from intracortical inhibition. First, suppression can be obtained with masks drifting too rapidly to elicit much of a response in cortex. Second, suppression is immune to hyperpolarization (through visual adaptation) of cortical neurons responding to the mask. Signals mediating suppression might originate in thalamus, rather than in cortex. Thalamic neurons exhibit some suppression; additional suppression might arise from depression at thalamocortical synapses. The mechanisms of suppression are subcortical and possibly include the very first synapse into cortex.},

@article{Sengpiel2005,
	abstract = {The response of neurons in the primary visual cortex to an optimally oriented grating is usually suppressed quite dramatically when a second grating of, for example, orthogonal orientation is superimposed. Such "cross-orientation suppression" has been implicated in the generation of cortical orientation selectivity and local response normalization. Until recently, little experimental evidence was available concerning the neurophysiological substrate of this phenomenon, although an involvement of intracortical inhibition was commonly assumed. However, Freeman et al. (2002) proposed that cortical cross-orientation suppression is caused by suppression in the thalamus and depression at geniculocortical synapses. Here, we examine a dichoptic form of cross-orientation suppression, termed interocular suppression and thought to be involved in binocular rivalry (Sengpiel et al., 1995a). We show that its dependency on the drift rate of the suppressing stimulus is consistent with a cortical origin; unlike monocular cross-orientation suppression, it cannot be evoked by very fast-moving stimuli. Moreover, we find that previous adaptation to the orthogonal stimulus essentially eliminates interocular suppression. Because adaptation is a cortical phenomenon, this result also argues in favor of a cortical locus of suppression, again unlike monocular cross-orientation suppression, which is not affected by adaptation to the suppressor (Freeman et al., 2002). Finally, interocular suppression is greatly reduced in the presence of the GABA antagonist bicuculline. Together, our study demonstrates that interocular suppression is substantially different from monocular cross-orientation suppression and is mediated by inhibitory circuitry within the visual cortex.},

@article{Yoon2010,
	abstract = {The neural mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia remain essentially unknown. The GABA hypothesis proposes that reduced neuronal GABA concentration and neurotransmission results in cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. However, few in vivo studies have directly examined this hypothesis. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at high field to measure visual cortical GABA levels in 13 subjects with schizophrenia and 13 demographically matched healthy control subjects. We found that the schizophrenia group had an approximately 10% reduction in GABA concentration. We further tested the GABA hypothesis by examining the relationship between visual cortical GABA levels and orientation-specific surround suppression (OSSS), a behavioral measure of visual inhibition thought to be dependent on GABAergic synaptic transmission. Previous work has shown that subjects with schizophrenia exhibit reduced OSSS of contrast discrimination (Yoon et al., 2009). For subjects with both MRS and OSSS data (n = 16), we found a highly significant positive correlation (r = 0.76) between these variables. GABA concentration was not correlated with overall contrast discrimination performance for stimuli without a surround (r = -0.10). These results suggest that a neocortical GABA deficit in subjects with schizophrenia leads to impaired cortical inhibition and that GABAergic synaptic transmission in visual cortex plays a critical role in OSSS.},

	abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive 'pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A 'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu.

@article{Benjamin2018,
	abstract = {Most of our knowledge about vision comes from experiments in which stimuli are presented to immobile human subjects or animals. In the case of human subjects, movement during psychophysical, electrophysiological, or neuroimaging experiments is considered to be a source of noise to be eliminated. Animals used in visual neuroscience experiments are typically restrained and, in many cases, anesthetized. In reality, however, vision is often used to guide the motion of awake, ambulating organisms. Recent work in mice has shown that locomotion elevates visual neuronal response amplitudes (Niell and Stryker, 2010; Erisken et al., 2014; Fu et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014; Mineault et al., 2016) and reduces long-range gain control (Ayaz et al., 2013). Here, we used both psychophysics and steady-state electrophysiology to investigate whether similar effects of locomotion on early visual processing can be measured in humans. Our psychophysical results show that brisk walking has little effect on subjects' ability to detect briefly presented contrast changes and that co-oriented flankers are, if anything, more effective masks when subjects are walking. Our electrophysiological data were consistent with the psychophysics indicating no increase in stimulus-driven neuronal responses while walking and no reduction in surround suppression. In summary, we have found evidence that early contrast processing is altered by locomotion in humans but in a manner that differs from that reported in mice. The effects of locomotion on very low-level visual processing may differ on a species-by-species basis and may reflect important differences in the levels of arousal associated with locomotion.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mice are the current model of choice for studying low-level visual processing. Recent studies have shown that mouse visual cortex is modulated by behavioral state: primary visual cortex neurons in locomoting mice tend to be more sensitive and less influenced by long-range gain control. Here, we tested these effects in humans by measuring psychophysical detection thresholds and electroencephalography (EEG) responses while subjects walked on a treadmill. We found no evidence of increased contrast sensitivity or reduced surround suppression in walking humans. Our data show that fundamental measurements of early visual processing differ between humans and mice and this has important implications for recent work on the links among arousal, behavior, and vision in these two species.},

	abstract = {Contrast masking from parallel grating surrounds (doughnuts) and superimposed orthogonal masks have different characteristics. However, it is not known whether the saturation of the underlying suppression that has been found for parallel doughnut masks depends on (i) relative mask and target orientation, (ii) stimulus eccentricity or (iii) surround suppression. We measured contrast-masking functions for target patches of grating in the fovea and in the periphery for cross-oriented superimposed and doughnut masks and parallel doughnut masks. When suppression was evident, the factor that determined whether it accelerated or saturated was whether the mask stimulus was crossed or parallel. There are at least two interpretations of the asymptotic behaviour of the parallel surround mask. (1) Suppression arises from pathways that saturate with (mask) contrast. (2) The target is processed by a mechanism that is subject to surround suppression at low target contrasts, but a less sensitive mechanism that is immune from surround suppression 'breaks through' at higher target contrasts. If the mask can be made less potent, then masking functions should shift downwards, and sideways for the two accounts, respectively. We manipulated the potency of the mask by varying the size of the hole in a parallel doughnut mask. The results provided strong evidence for the first account but not the second. On the view that response compression becomes more severe progressing up the visual pathway, our results suggest that superimposed cross-orientation suppression precedes orientation tuned surround suppression. These results also reveal a previously unrecognized similarity between surround suppression and crowding (Pelli, Palomares, & Majaj, 2004).},

This cross-orientation suppression (COS) is exhibited when the orthogonal and optimal stimuli are presented to the same eye (monoptically) or to different eyes (dichoptically). A recent study suggested that monoptic COS arises from subcortical processes; however, the mechanisms underlying dichoptic COS were not addressed. We have compared the temporal frequency tuning and stimulus adaptation properties of monoptic and dichoptic COS. We found that dichoptic COS is best elicited with lower temporal frequencies and is substantially reduced after prolonged adaptation to a mask grating. In contrast, monoptic COS is more pronounced with mask gratings at much higher temporal frequencies and is less prone to stimulus adaptation. These results suggest that monoptic COS is mediated by subcortical mechanisms, whereas intracortical inhibition is the mechanism for dichoptic COS.},

	abstract = {Visual mechanisms in primary visual cortex are suppressed by the superposition of gratings perpendicular to their preferred orientations. A clear picture of this process is needed to (i) inform functional architecture of image-processing models, (ii) identify the pathways available to support binocular rivalry, and (iii) generally advance our understanding of early vision. Here we use monoptic sine-wave gratings and cross-orientation masking (XOM) to reveal two cross-oriented suppressive pathways in humans, both of which occur before full binocular summation of signals. One is a within-eye (ipsiocular) pathway that is spatially broadband, immune to contrast adaptation and has a suppressive weight that tends to decrease with stimulus duration. The other pathway operates between the eyes (interocular), is spatially tuned, desensitizes with contrast adaptation and has a suppressive weight that increases with stimulus duration. When cross-oriented masks are presented to both eyes, masking is enhanced or diminished for conditions in which either ipsiocular or interocular pathways dominate masking, respectively. We propose that ipsiocular suppression precedes the influence of interocular suppression and tentatively associate the two effects with the lateral geniculate nucleus (or retina) and the visual cortex respectively. The interocular route is a good candidate for the initial pathway involved in binocular rivalry and predicts that interocular cross-orientation suppression should be found in cortical cells with predominantly ipsiocular drive.},

	abstract = {Cortical visual neurons in the cat and monkey are inhibited by stimuli surrounding their receptive fields (surround suppression) or presented within their receptive fields (cross-orientation or overlay suppression). We show that human contrast sensitivity is similarly affected by two distinct suppression mechanisms. In agreement with the animal studies, human surround suppression is tightly tuned to the orientation and spatial frequency of the test, unlike overlay suppression. Using a double-masking paradigm, we also show that in humans, overlay suppression precedes surround suppression in the processing sequence. Surprisingly, we find that, unlike overlay suppression, surround suppression is only strong in the periphery (> 1 degree eccentricity). This result argues for a new functional distinction between foveal and peripheral operations.},
