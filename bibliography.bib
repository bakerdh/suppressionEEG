@article{Zhou2015,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Several recent studies have demonstrated that following short-term monocular deprivation in normal adults, the patched eye, rather than the unpatched eye, becomes stronger in subsequent binocular viewing. However, little is known about the site and nature of the underlying processes. In this study, we examine the underlying mechanisms by measuring steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as an index of the neural contrast response in early visual areas.
METHODS: The experiment consisted of three consecutive stages: a pre-patching EEG recording (14 minutes), a monocular patching stage (2.5 hours) and a post-patching EEG recording (14 minutes; started immediately after the removal of the patch). During the patching stage, a diffuser (transmits light but not pattern) was placed in front of one randomly selected eye. During the EEG recording stage, contrast response functions for each eye were measured.
RESULTS: The neural responses from the patched eye increased after the removal of the patch, whilst the responses from the unpatched eye remained the same. Such phenomena occurred under both monocular and dichoptic viewing conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: We interpret this eye dominance plasticity in adult human visual cortex as homeostatic intrinsic plasticity regulated by an increase of contrast-gain in the patched eye.},

@article{Baker2015,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Visual deficits in amblyopia are neural in origin, yet are difficult to characterize with functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI). Our aim was to develop an objective electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm that can be used to provide a clinically useful index of amblyopic deficits.
METHODS: We used steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to measure full contrast response functions in both amblyopic (n = 10, strabismic or mixed amblyopia, mean age: 44 years) and control (n = 5, mean age: 31 years) observers, both with and without a dichoptic mask.
RESULTS: At the highest target contrast, the ratio of amplitudes across the weaker and stronger eyes was highly correlated (r = 0.76) with the acuity ratio between the eyes. We also found that the contrast response function in the amblyopic eye had both a greatly reduced amplitude and a shallower slope, but that surprisingly dichoptic masking was weaker than in controls. The results were compared with the predictions of a computational model of amblyopia and suggest a modification to the model whereby excitatory (but not suppressive) signals are attenuated in the amblyopic eye.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that SSVEPs offer a sensitive and objective measure of the ocular imbalance in amblyopia and could be used to assess the efficacy of amblyopia therapies currently under development.},

	abstract = {The balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain affects both neural responses and behaviour in humans and animals. Here we investigated whether dietary intervention aimed at increasing levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can influence neural responses to basic sensory stimuli. Using a steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm, we found that the neural response to visual patterns was reduced in individuals who consumed a yeast extract product rich in substances associated with the production of GABA (glutamate and B vitamins), but not in a control group who consumed a placebo substance ( n = 14 per group). This demonstrates that the balance of excitation and inhibition in the brain can be influenced by dietary interventions, suggesting possible clinical benefits in conditions (e.g. epilepsy) where inhibition is abnormal.},

@article{Vanegas2019,
	abstract = {Over the last decades, psychophysical and electrophysiological studies in patients and animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD), have consistently revealed a number of visual abnormalities. In particular, specific alterations of contrast sensitivity curves, electroretinogram (ERG), and visual-evoked potentials (VEP), have been attributed to dopaminergic retinal depletion. However, fundamental mechanisms of cortical visual processing, such as normalization or "gain control" computations, have not yet been examined in PD patients. Here, we measured electrophysiological indices of gain control in both space (surround suppression) and time (sensory adaptation) in PD patients based on steady-state VEP (ssVEP). Compared with controls, patients exhibited a significantly higher initial ssVEP amplitude that quickly decayed over time, and greater relative suppression of ssVEP amplitude as a function of surrounding stimulus contrast. Meanwhile, EEG frequency spectra were broadly elevated in patients relative to controls. Thus, contrary to what might be expected given the reduced contrast sensitivity often reported in PD, visual neural responses are not weaker; rather, they are initially larger but undergo an exaggerated degree of spatial and temporal gain control and are embedded within a greater background noise level. These differences may reflect cortical mechanisms that compensate for dysfunctional center-surround interactions at the retinal level.},

@article{Hou2020,
	abstract = {During binocular viewing, visual inputs from the two eyes interact at the level of visual cortex. Here we studied binocular interactions in human visual cortex, including both sexes, using source-imaged steady-state visual evoked potentials over a wide range of relative contrast between two eyes. The ROIs included areas V1, V3a, hV4, hMT+, and lateral occipital cortex. Dichoptic parallel grating stimuli in each eye modulated at distinct temporal frequencies allowed us to quantify spectral components associated with the individual stimuli from monocular inputs (self-terms) and responses due to interaction between the inputs from the two eyes (intermodulation [IM] terms). Data with self-terms revealed an interocular suppression effect, in which the responses to the stimulus in one eye were reduced when a stimulus was presented simultaneously to the other eye. The suppression magnitude varied depending on visual area, and the relative contrast between the two eyes. Suppression was strongest in V1 and V3a (50% reduction) and was least in lateral occipital cortex (20% reduction). Data with IM terms revealed another form of binocular interaction, compared with self-terms. IM response was strongest at V1 and was least in hV4. Fits of a family of divisive gain control models to both self- and IM-term responses within each cortical area indicated that both forms of binocular interaction shared a common gain control nonlinearity. However, our model fits revealed different patterns of binocular interaction along the cortical hierarchy, particularly in terms of excitatory and suppressive contributions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Using source-imaged steady-state visual evoked potentials and frequency-domain analysis of dichoptic stimuli, we measured two forms of binocular interactions: one is associated with the individual stimuli that represent interocular suppression from each eye, and the other is a direct measure of interocular interaction between inputs from the two eyes. We demonstrated that both forms of binocular interactions share a common gain control mechanism in striate and extra-striate cortex. Furthermore, our model fits revealed different patterns of binocular interaction along the visual cortical hierarchy, particularly in terms of excitatory and suppressive contributions.},

@article{Ross1991,
	abstract = {After a preliminary study of visual evoked potentials (VEPS) to a test grating seen in the presence of masks at different orientations, psychophysical data are presented showing the effects of adaptation and of masking on thresholds for detecting the same test grating. The test is a vertical grating of spatial frequency 2 cycles per degree; adapting and masking gratings differ from the test either in orientation or in spatial frequency. The effects of adaptation and masking are explained by a single mechanism model that assumes: (i) adaptation and masking both alter the contrast response (or transducer) function of the mechanism that detects the test; (ii) masks, but not adaptors, stimulate the mechanism that detects the test; and (iii) a test is detectable when it raises response level by a constant amount. The model incorporates two distinct tuning functions, a broad adaptive contrast function and a narrow effective contrast function. It accounts adequately for all the data, including the location and size of the facilitative dip found in some masking functions, the constant slopes of the threshold elevation segments of adaptation functions and the varying slopes of masking functions. It also predicts the sometimes surprising joint effects of adaptation followed by masking and of two masks operating simultaneously.},

@article{Candy2001,
	abstract = {Human infants can discriminate the orientation of lines within the first week after birth (Atkinson et al., 1988; Slater et al., 1988) but have immature orientation-selective pattern masking until after 6 months of age (Morrone and Burr, 1986). Here the development of orientation processing is further examined using a visual-evoked potential paradigm and normalization models of pattern masking. Contrast response functions were measured for 1 cycle per degree (cpd) gratings, counterphase-reversed in contrast at either 3.3 or 5.5 Hz. A second 1 cpd, 20% contrast, 8.3 Hz grating of either the same or orthogonal orientation was added as a mask. Evoked responses associated with the test grating, the mask, and intermodulation between the two were individually extracted using spectral analysis of the scalp-recorded EEG. Adults exhibited orientation selectivity in the masking of their test component responses and in nonlinear intermodulation between the test and mask stimuli. Infants <5 months old, however, demonstrated nonselective masking or a reversed selectivity in their responses to the test component, with adult-like orientation selectivity in their intermodulation responses. Within the context of a normalization model of pattern masking, the results are consistent with the existence of oriented filters early in life the responses of which are normalized immaturely until approximately 5 months of age.},

@article{Burr1987,
	abstract = {1. Visual evoked potentials (v.e.p.s) were recorded from human adults to investigate orientation-specific neural interactions. The stimuli were the sum of two gratings, sinusoidally modulated in space and time at different frequencies. Recordings were made for one grating (test) alone, and with another superimposed grating (mask), oriented parallel or orthogonal to the test. The amplitude and phase of the v.e.p.s at twice the test modulation frequency (second harmonic) was measured as a function of test contrast to produce contrast-response curves. 2. Orthogonal masks attenuated considerably the amplitude of v.e.p.s. The attenuation at any given contrast was approximately proportional, or multiplicative, lowering the slope of the contrast-response curve, without affecting significantly the extrapolated threshold. Parallel masks also attenuated v.e.p. amplitudes but in a different way, leaving the slope of the contrast-response curves unchanged, while elevating threshold. 3. The attenuation by orthogonal masks occurred over a wide range of test spatial frequencies, from 0.8 to 8 cycles/deg. For any given test spatial frequency, the most effective masks were those of spatial frequency similar to or lower than the test. Masks of spatial frequency 1.5 octaves higher than the test did not attenuate v.e.p. amplitudes. 4. The mask temporal frequency for maximal attenuation of v.e.p. amplitude was around 12 Hz, with stationary masks having little effect. 5. Under most conditions, the phase of the second harmonic of the v.e.p., increased with increasing contrast (phase advance). Superimposition of a parallel mask abolished phase advance, while orthogonal masks increased it. 6. Comparisons with single cortical unit and evoked potential recordings in cats suggest that the attenuation by orthogonal masks reflects intracortical inhibitory interactions between cell populations of different orientation preference.},

@article{Ayaz2009,
	abstract = {Gain modulation of neuronal responses is widely observed in the cerebral cortex of both anesthetized and behaving animals. Does this multiplicative effect on neuronal tuning curves require underlying multiplicative mechanisms of integration? We compare the effects of a divisive mechanism of inhibition (noisy excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs) with the effects of two subtractive mechanisms (shunting conductance and hyperpolarizing current) on the tuning curves of a model cortical neuron. We find that, although the effects of subtractive inhibition can appear nonlinear, they are accompanied by a change in response threshold and are best described as a vertical shift along the response axis. Increasing noisy synaptic activity divisively scales the model responses, reproducing a response-gain control effect. When mutual inhibition between subpopulations of local neurons is included, the model exhibits a gain modulation effect that is better described as input-gain control. We apply these findings to experimental data by examining how noisy synaptic input may underlie divisive surround suppression and attention-driven gain modulation of neuronal responses in the visual system.},

@article{Chadnova2018,
	abstract = {Interocular interaction in the visual system occurs under dichoptic conditions when contrast and luminance are imbalanced between the eyes. Human psychophysical investigations suggest that interocular interaction can be explained by a contrast normalization model. However, the neural processes that underlie such interactions are still unresolved. We set out to assess, for the first time, the proposed normalization model of interocular contrast interactions using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and to extend this model to incorporate interactions based on interocular luminance differences. We used MEG to record steady-state visual evoked responses (SSVER), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to obtain individual retinotopic maps that we used in combination with MEG source imaging in healthy participants. Binary noise stimuli were presented in monocular or dichoptic viewing and were frequency-tagged at 4 and 6 Hz. The contrast of the stimuli was modulated in a range between 0 and 32%. Monocularly, we reduced the luminance by placing a 1.5 ND filter over one eye in the maximal contrast condition. This ND filter reduces the mean light level by a factor of 30 without any alteration to the physical contrast. We observed in visual area V1 a monotonic increase in the magnitude of SSVERs with changes in contrast from 0 to 32%. For both eyes, dichoptic masking induced a decrease in SSVER signal power. This power decrease was well explained by the normalization model. Reducing mean luminance delayed monocular processing by approximately 38 ms in V1. The reduced luminance also decreased the masking ability of the eye under the filter. Predictions based on a temporal filtering model for the interocular luminance difference prior to the model's binocular combination stage were incorporated to update the normalization model. Our results demonstrate that the signals resulting from different contrast or luminance stimulation of the two eyes are combined in a way that can be explained by an interocular normalization model.},

@article{Vanegas2015,
	abstract = {Surround suppression is a well-known example of contextual interaction in visual cortical neurophysiology, whereby the neural response to a stimulus presented within a neuron's classical receptive field is suppressed by surrounding stimuli. Human psychophysical reports present an obvious analog to the effects seen at the single-neuron level: stimuli are perceived as lower-contrast when embedded in a surround. Here we report on a visual paradigm that provides relatively direct, straightforward indices of surround suppression in human electrophysiology, enabling us to reproduce several well-known neurophysiological and psychophysical effects, and to conduct new analyses of temporal trends and retinal location effects. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) elicited by flickering "foreground" stimuli were measured in the context of various static surround patterns. Early visual cortex geometry and retinotopic organization were exploited to enhance SSVEP amplitude. The foreground response was strongly suppressed as a monotonic function of surround contrast. Furthermore, suppression was stronger for surrounds of matching orientation than orthogonally-oriented ones, and stronger at peripheral than foveal locations. These patterns were reproduced in psychophysical reports of perceived contrast, and peripheral electrophysiological suppression effects correlated with psychophysical effects across subjects. Temporal analysis of SSVEP amplitude revealed short-term contrast adaptation effects that caused the foreground signal to either fall or grow over time, depending on the relative contrast of the surround, consistent with stronger adaptation of the suppressive drive. This electrophysiology paradigm has clinical potential in indexing not just visual deficits but possibly gain control deficits expressed more widely in the disordered brain. },

	abstract = {The responses of neurons in the primate and cat primary visual cortices (V1s) to the stimuli within their classical receptive fields (CRFs) are markedly suppressed by the surrounding stimuli outside CRFs. In the present study, we show that a similar suppressive effect occurs for visually evoked magnetic responses in the human visual cortex. The initial peak amplitude of the magnetic response (at a latency of around 90 ms) to a test grating accompanied by high-contrast surround gratings was smaller than that for the test without the surround. Current source localization with a single dipole model indicated that the initial response originated from cortical activity near the occipital pole in the contralateral hemisphere to the visual stimulation. The peak amplitude for the test decreased with increasing surround contrast, and increased with increasing test contrast. The contrast dependence and the early development of the surround suppression were in agreement with the results of the V1 single-cell studies of monkeys and cats. We suggest that the surround suppression of the initial peak amplitude of the magnetic response may be ascribed to the inhibition of the neural activity at the early processing stage(s), presumably at V1, in the human visual cortex.},

	abstract = {When a target stimulus is embedded in a high contrast surround, the target appears reduced in contrast and is harder to detect, and neural responses in visual cortex are suppressed. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and psychophysics to quantitatively compare these physiological and perceptual effects. Observers performed a contrast discrimination task on a contrast-reversing sinusoidal target grating. The target was either presented in isolation or embedded in a high-contrast surround. While observers performed the task, we also measured fMRI responses as a function of target contrast, both with and without a surround. We found that the surround substantially increased the psychophysical thresholds while reducing fMRI responses. The two data sets were compared, on the basis of the assumption that a fixed response difference is required for correct discrimination, and we found that the psychophysics accounted for 96.5% of the variance in the measured V1 responses. The suppression in visual areas V2 and V3 was stronger, too strong to agree with psychophysics. The good quantitative agreement between psychophysical thresholds and V1 responses suggests V1 as a plausible candidate for mediating surround masking.},

	abstract = {The responsivity of primary sensory cortical neurons is reduced following prolonged adaptation, but such adaptation has been little studied in higher sensory areas. Adaptation to visual motion has strong perceptual effects, so we studied the effect of prolonged stimulation on neuronal responsivity in the macaque's area MT, a cortical area whose importance to visual motion perception is well established. We adapted MT neurons with sinusoidal gratings drifting in the preferred or null direction. Preferred adaptation reduced the responsiveness of MT cells, primarily by changing their contrast gain, and this effect was spatially specific within the receptive field. Null adaptation reduced the ability of null gratings to inhibit the response to a simultaneously presented preferred stimulus. While both preferred and null adaptation alter MT responses, these effects probably do not occur in MT neurons but are likely to reflect adaptation-induced changes in contrast gain earlier in the visual pathway.},

@article{Albrecht1984,
	abstract = {Spatial contrast adaptation, produced by prolonged exposure to high contrast grating patterns, has become an important psychophysical method for isolating spatial and orientation selective channels in the human visual system. It has been reasonably argued that this adaptation may be fundamentally dependent upon the activity of neurones in the striate cortex. To test the validity of this hypothesis, and several others, we measured the general adaptation characteristics of 144 striate neurones using a stimulus protocol comparable to the typical psychophysical methods. In general, during prolonged high contrast stimulation, the responses of most cells exponentially decayed from a transient peak response to a sustained plateau response; following adaptation, the responses to lower contrasts were depressed relative to the unadapted state but then gradually recovered from the transient depression to a sustained plateau. Such adaptation was a property common to both simple and complex cells (the distributions of the quantitative of adaptation were overlapping); there were however small but reliable differences. We compared the neurophysiological contrast adaptation with two psychophysical estimates of human contrast adaptation (threshold contrast elevation and apparent contrast reduction) and found that the time courses and the magnitudes were quite similar. The effect of contrast adaptation on the spatial frequency tuning was assessed by measuring the contrast response function at several different test spatial frequencies before and after adaptation at the optimum centre frequency. We found that the effect of adaptation decreased as the difference between test and adaptation frequency increased. Grating contrast adaptation has been alternatively described as 'constructive gain control' on the one hand and as 'deleterious fatigue' on the other. We tested the effect of contrast adaptation on the contrast response function and found (a) that adaptation shifts the curves vertically downward parallel to the response axis (thus reflecting a decrease in the maximum rate of firing and a deleterious compression of the response range) and (b) that adaptation shifts the curves horizontally to the right parallel to the contrast axis (thus reflecting a true sensitivity shift of the remaining response range for constructive maintenance of high differential sensitivity around the prevailing background level).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{Ledgeway2005,
	abstract = {Cortical neurons selective for the direction of motion often exhibit some limited response to motion in their nonpreferred directions. Here we examine the dependence of neuronal direction selectivity on stimulus contrast, both for first-order (luminance-modulated, sine-wave grating) and second-order (contrast-modulated envelope) stimuli. We measured responses from single neurons in area 18 of cat visual cortex to both kinds of moving stimuli over a wide range of contrasts (1.25-80%). Direction-selective contrast response functions (CRFs) were calculated as the preferred-minus-null difference in average firing frequency as a function of contrast. We also applied receiver operating characteristic analysis to our CRF data to obtain neurometric functions characterizing the potential ability of each neuron to discriminate motion direction at each contrast level tested. CRFs for sine-wave gratings were usually monotonic; however, a substantial minority of neurons (35%) exhibited nonmonotonic CRFs (such that the degree of direction selectivity decreased with increasing contrast). The underlying preferred and nonpreferred direction CRFs were diverse, often having different shapes in a given neuron. Neurometric functions for direction discrimination showed a similar degree of heterogeneity, including instances of nonmonotonicity. For contrast-modulated stimuli, however, CRFs for either carrier or envelope contrast were always monotonic. In a given neuron, neurometric thresholds were typically much higher for second- than for first-order stimuli. These results demonstrate that the degree of a cell's direction selectivity depends on the contrast at which it is measured, and therefore is not a characteristic parameter of a neuron. In general, contrast response functions for first-order stimuli were very heterogeneous in shape and sensitivity, while those for second-order stimuli showed less sensitivity and were quite stereotyped in shape.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) are two noninvasive methods commonly used to study neural mechanisms supporting visual attention in humans. Studies using these tools, which have complementary spatial and temporal resolutions, implicitly assume they index similar underlying neural modulations related to external stimulus and internal attentional manipulations. Accordingly, they are often used interchangeably for constraining understanding about the impact of bottom-up and top-down factors on neural modulations. To test this core assumption, we simultaneously manipulated bottom-up sensory inputs by varying stimulus contrast and top-down cognitive modulations by changing the focus of spatial attention. Each of the male and female subjects participated in both fMRI and EEG sessions performing the same experimental paradigm. We found categorically different patterns of attentional modulation on fMRI activity in early visual cortex and early stimulus-evoked potentials measured via EEG (e.g., the P1 component and steady-state visually-evoked potentials): fMRI activation scaled additively with attention, whereas evoked EEG components scaled multiplicatively with attention. However, across longer time scales, a contralateral negative-going potential and oscillatory EEG signals in the alpha band revealed additive attentional modulation patterns like those observed with fMRI. These results challenge prior assumptions that fMRI and early stimulus-evoked potentials measured with EEG can be interchangeably used to index the same neural mechanisms of attentional modulations at different spatiotemporal scales. Instead, fMRI measures of attentional modulations are more closely linked with later EEG components and alpha-band oscillations. Considered together, hemodynamic and electrophysiological signals can jointly constrain understanding of the neural mechanisms supporting cognition.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT fMRI and EEG have been used as tools to measure the location and timing of attentional modulations in visual cortex and are often used interchangeably for constraining computational models under the assumption that they index similar underlying neural processes. However, by varying attentional and stimulus parameters, we found differential patterns of attentional modulations of fMRI activity in early visual cortex and commonly used stimulus-evoked potentials measured via EEG. Instead, across longer time scales, a contralateral negative-going potential and EEG oscillations in the alpha band exhibited attentional modulations similar to those observed with fMRI. Together, these results suggest that different physiological processes assayed by these complementary techniques must be jointly considered when making inferences about the neural underpinnings of cognitive operations.},

We tested several computational models against data from steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) experiments in humans, using periodic visual stimuli combined across either retinal location or eye-of-presentation. A model in which signals are raised to an exponent before being summed in both the numerator and the denominator of a gain control nonlinearity gave the best account of the data. This model also predicted the pattern of responses in a range of additional conditions accurately and with no free parameters, as well as predicting responses at harmonic and intermodulation frequencies between 1 and 30 Hz. We speculate that this model implements the optimal algorithm for combining multiple noisy inputs, in which responses are proportional to the weighted sum of both inputs. This suggests a novel purpose for cortical gain control: implementing optimal signal combination via mutual inhibition, perhaps explaining its ubiquity as a neural computation.},

Population responses to two superimposed gratings were weighted sums of the individual grating responses. The weights depended strongly on the relative contrasts of the gratings. When the contrasts were similar, the population performed an approximately equal summation. When the contrasts differed markedly, however, the population performed approximately a winner-take-all competition. Stimuli that were intermediate to these extremes elicited intermediate responses. This entire range of behaviors was explained by a single model of contrast normalization. Normalization captured both the spike responses and the local field potential responses; it even predicted visually evoked currents source-localized to V1 in human subjects. Normalization has profound effects on V1 population responses and is likely to shape the interpretation of these responses by higher cortical areas.},

	abstract = {White pixel noise is widely used to estimate the level of internal noise in a system by injecting external variance into the detecting mechanism. Recent work (Baker and Meese, 2012) has provided psychophysical evidence that such noise masks might also cause suppression that could invalidate estimates of internal noise. Here we measure neural population responses directly, using steady-state visual evoked potentials, elicited by target stimuli embedded in different mask types. Sinusoidal target gratings of 1 c/deg flickered at 5 Hz, and were shown in isolation, or with superimposed orthogonal grating masks or 2D white noise masks, flickering at 7 Hz. Compared with responses to a blank screen, the Fourier amplitude at the target frequency increased monotonically as a function of target contrast when no mask was present. Both orthogonal and white noise masks caused rightward shifts of the contrast response function, providing evidence of contrast gain control suppression. We also calculated within-observer amplitude variance across trials. This increased in proportion to the target response, implying signal-dependent (i.e., multiplicative) noise at the system level, the implications of which we discuss for behavioral tasks. This measure of variance was reduced by both mask types, consistent with the changes in mean target response. An alternative variety of noise, which we term zero-dimensional noise, involves trial-by-trial jittering of the target contrast. This type of noise produced no gain control suppression, and increased the amplitude variance across trials. },

However, the nature of long-range contrast normalization in chromatic signals has been less studied. Here we use a combination of neuroimaging data from source-imaged EEG and two different psychophysical measures of surround suppression to study contrast normalization in stimuli containing achromatic luminance and S-cone-isolating contrast. In an appearance matching task, we find strong within-channel but little between-channel suppression. However, using a contrast increment detection task, we do find evidence for weak but significant between-channel effects. Our neural measurements agree with the appearance matching data, showing significant within-channel suppression and no significant interactions between signals initiated in different pre-cortical pathways. We hypothesize that appearance judgments and V1 population responses are dominated by neurons with chromatically matched classical and extra-classical surrounds while contrast increment detection tasks rely on a subpopulation of neurons that have extra-classical surrounds sensitive to both chromatic and achromatic contrasts. Our psychophysical and source-imaged EEG results are consistent with a hypothesis based on natural scene statistics that long-range contrast normalization in early visual system is largely driven by signals within the same chromatic channel.},

Here we studied the neural mechanisms of masking in humans using source-imaged steady state visual evoked potentials and frequency-domain analysis over a wide range of relative stimulus strengths of test and mask stimuli. Test and mask stimuli were tagged with distinct temporal frequencies and we quantified spectral response components associated with the individual stimuli (self terms) and responses due to interaction between stimuli (intermodulation terms). In early visual cortex, masking alters the self terms in a manner consistent with a reduction of input contrast. We also identify a novel signature of masking: a robust intermodulation term that peaks when the test and mask stimuli have equal contrast and disappears when they are widely different. We fit all of our data simultaneously with family of a divisive gain control models that differed only in their dynamics. Models with either very short or very long temporal integration constants for the gain pool performed worse than a model with an integration time of ∼30 ms. Finally, the absolute magnitudes of the response were controlled by the ratio of the stimulus contrasts, not their absolute values. This contrast-contrast invariance suggests that many neurons in early visual cortex code relative rather than absolute contrast. Together, these results provide a more complete description of masking within the normalization framework of contrast gain control and suggest that contrast normalization accomplishes multiple functional goals.},

	abstract = {Early psychological researchers proposed a link between intelligence and low-level perceptual performance. It was recently suggested that this link is driven by individual variations in the ability to suppress irrelevant information, evidenced by the observation of strong correlations between perceptual surround suppression and cognitive performance. However, the neural mechanisms underlying such a link remain unclear. A candidate mechanism is neural inhibition by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but direct experimental support for GABA-mediated inhibition underlying suppression is inconsistent. Here we report evidence consistent with a global suppressive mechanism involving GABA underlying the link between sensory performance and intelligence. We measured visual cortical GABA concentration, visuo-spatial intelligence and visual surround suppression in a group of healthy adults. Levels of GABA were strongly predictive of both intelligence and surround suppression, with higher levels of intelligence associated with higher levels of GABA and stronger surround suppression. These results indicate that GABA-mediated neural inhibition may be a key factor determining cognitive performance and suggests a physiological mechanism linking surround suppression and intelligence. },

	abstract = {Gain control is a salient feature of information processing throughout the visual system. Heeger (1991, 1992) described a mechanism that could underpin gain control in primary visual cortex (V1). According to this model, a neuron's response is normalized by dividing its output by the sum of a population of neurons, which are selective for orientations covering a broad range. Gain control in this scheme is manifested as a change in the semisaturation constant (contrast gain) of a V1 neuron. Here we examine how flanking and annular gratings of the same or orthogonal orientation to that preferred by a neuron presented beyond the receptive field modulate gain in V1 neurons in anesthetized marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). To characterize how gain was modulated by surround stimuli, the Michaelis-Menten equation was fitted to response versus contrast functions obtained under each stimulus condition. The modulation of gain by surround stimuli was modelled best as a divisive reduction in response gain. Response gain varied with the orientation of surround stimuli, but was reduced most when the orientation of a large annular grating beyond the classical receptive field matched the preferred orientation of neurons. The strength of surround suppression did not vary significantly with retinal eccentricity or laminar distribution. In the marmoset, as in macaques (Angelucci et al., 2002a,b), gain control over the sort of distances reported here (up to 10 deg) may be mediated by feedback from extrastriate areas.},

@article{Nassi2013,
	abstract = {Feedback connections are prevalent throughout the cerebral cortex, yet their function remains poorly understood. Previous studies in anesthetized monkeys found that inactivating feedback from extrastriate visual cortex produced effects in striate cortex that were relatively weak, generally suppressive, largest for visual stimuli confined to the receptive field center, and detectable only at low stimulus contrast. We studied the influence of corticocortical feedback in alert monkeys using cortical cooling to reversibly inactivate visual areas 2 (V2) and 3 (V3) while characterizing receptive field properties in primary visual cortex (V1). We show that inactivation of feedback from areas V2 and V3 results in both response suppression and facilitation for stimuli restricted to the receptive field center, in most cases leading to a small reduction in the degree of orientation selectivity but no change in orientation preference. For larger-diameter stimuli that engage regions beyond the center of the receptive field, eliminating feedback from V2 and V3 results in strong and consistent response facilitation, effectively reducing the strength of surround suppression in V1 for stimuli of both low and high contrast. For extended contours, eliminating feedback had the effect of reducing end stopping. Inactivation effects were largest for neurons that exhibited strong surround suppression before inactivation, and their timing matched the dynamics of surround suppression under control conditions. Our results provide direct evidence that feedback contributes to surround suppression, which is an important source of contextual influences essential to vision.},

@article{Freeman2002,
	abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are thought to receive inhibition from other V1 neurons selective for a variety of orientations. Evidence for this inhibition is commonly found in cross-orientation suppression: responses of a V1 neuron to optimally oriented bars are suppressed by superimposed mask bars of different orientation. We show, however, that suppression is unlikely to result from intracortical inhibition. First, suppression can be obtained with masks drifting too rapidly to elicit much of a response in cortex. Second, suppression is immune to hyperpolarization (through visual adaptation) of cortical neurons responding to the mask. Signals mediating suppression might originate in thalamus, rather than in cortex. Thalamic neurons exhibit some suppression; additional suppression might arise from depression at thalamocortical synapses. The mechanisms of suppression are subcortical and possibly include the very first synapse into cortex.},

@article{Sengpiel2005,
	abstract = {The response of neurons in the primary visual cortex to an optimally oriented grating is usually suppressed quite dramatically when a second grating of, for example, orthogonal orientation is superimposed. Such "cross-orientation suppression" has been implicated in the generation of cortical orientation selectivity and local response normalization. Until recently, little experimental evidence was available concerning the neurophysiological substrate of this phenomenon, although an involvement of intracortical inhibition was commonly assumed. However, Freeman et al. (2002) proposed that cortical cross-orientation suppression is caused by suppression in the thalamus and depression at geniculocortical synapses. Here, we examine a dichoptic form of cross-orientation suppression, termed interocular suppression and thought to be involved in binocular rivalry (Sengpiel et al., 1995a). We show that its dependency on the drift rate of the suppressing stimulus is consistent with a cortical origin; unlike monocular cross-orientation suppression, it cannot be evoked by very fast-moving stimuli. Moreover, we find that previous adaptation to the orthogonal stimulus essentially eliminates interocular suppression. Because adaptation is a cortical phenomenon, this result also argues in favor of a cortical locus of suppression, again unlike monocular cross-orientation suppression, which is not affected by adaptation to the suppressor (Freeman et al., 2002). Finally, interocular suppression is greatly reduced in the presence of the GABA antagonist bicuculline. Together, our study demonstrates that interocular suppression is substantially different from monocular cross-orientation suppression and is mediated by inhibitory circuitry within the visual cortex.},

@article{Yoon2010,
	abstract = {The neural mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia remain essentially unknown. The GABA hypothesis proposes that reduced neuronal GABA concentration and neurotransmission results in cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. However, few in vivo studies have directly examined this hypothesis. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at high field to measure visual cortical GABA levels in 13 subjects with schizophrenia and 13 demographically matched healthy control subjects. We found that the schizophrenia group had an approximately 10% reduction in GABA concentration. We further tested the GABA hypothesis by examining the relationship between visual cortical GABA levels and orientation-specific surround suppression (OSSS), a behavioral measure of visual inhibition thought to be dependent on GABAergic synaptic transmission. Previous work has shown that subjects with schizophrenia exhibit reduced OSSS of contrast discrimination (Yoon et al., 2009). For subjects with both MRS and OSSS data (n = 16), we found a highly significant positive correlation (r = 0.76) between these variables. GABA concentration was not correlated with overall contrast discrimination performance for stimuli without a surround (r = -0.10). These results suggest that a neocortical GABA deficit in subjects with schizophrenia leads to impaired cortical inhibition and that GABAergic synaptic transmission in visual cortex plays a critical role in OSSS.},

	abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

	abstract = {Most of our knowledge about vision comes from experiments in which stimuli are presented to immobile human subjects or animals. In the case of human subjects, movement during psychophysical, electrophysiological, or neuroimaging experiments is considered to be a source of noise to be eliminated. Animals used in visual neuroscience experiments are typically restrained and, in many cases, anesthetized. In reality, however, vision is often used to guide the motion of awake, ambulating organisms. Recent work in mice has shown that locomotion elevates visual neuronal response amplitudes (Niell and Stryker, 2010; Erisken et al., 2014; Fu et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014; Mineault et al., 2016) and reduces long-range gain control (Ayaz et al., 2013). Here, we used both psychophysics and steady-state electrophysiology to investigate whether similar effects of locomotion on early visual processing can be measured in humans. Our psychophysical results show that brisk walking has little effect on subjects' ability to detect briefly presented contrast changes and that co-oriented flankers are, if anything, more effective masks when subjects are walking. Our electrophysiological data were consistent with the psychophysics indicating no increase in stimulus-driven neuronal responses while walking and no reduction in surround suppression. In summary, we have found evidence that early contrast processing is altered by locomotion in humans but in a manner that differs from that reported in mice. The effects of locomotion on very low-level visual processing may differ on a species-by-species basis and may reflect important differences in the levels of arousal associated with locomotion.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mice are the current model of choice for studying low-level visual processing. Recent studies have shown that mouse visual cortex is modulated by behavioral state: primary visual cortex neurons in locomoting mice tend to be more sensitive and less influenced by long-range gain control. Here, we tested these effects in humans by measuring psychophysical detection thresholds and electroencephalography (EEG) responses while subjects walked on a treadmill. We found no evidence of increased contrast sensitivity or reduced surround suppression in walking humans. Our data show that fundamental measurements of early visual processing differ between humans and mice and this has important implications for recent work on the links among arousal, behavior, and vision in these two species.},

@article{Meese2009,
	abstract = {Contrast masking from parallel grating surrounds (doughnuts) and superimposed orthogonal masks have different characteristics. However, it is not known whether the saturation of the underlying suppression that has been found for parallel doughnut masks depends on (i) relative mask and target orientation, (ii) stimulus eccentricity or (iii) surround suppression. We measured contrast-masking functions for target patches of grating in the fovea and in the periphery for cross-oriented superimposed and doughnut masks and parallel doughnut masks. When suppression was evident, the factor that determined whether it accelerated or saturated was whether the mask stimulus was crossed or parallel. There are at least two interpretations of the asymptotic behaviour of the parallel surround mask. (1) Suppression arises from pathways that saturate with (mask) contrast. (2) The target is processed by a mechanism that is subject to surround suppression at low target contrasts, but a less sensitive mechanism that is immune from surround suppression 'breaks through' at higher target contrasts. If the mask can be made less potent, then masking functions should shift downwards, and sideways for the two accounts, respectively. We manipulated the potency of the mask by varying the size of the hole in a parallel doughnut mask. The results provided strong evidence for the first account but not the second. On the view that response compression becomes more severe progressing up the visual pathway, our results suggest that superimposed cross-orientation suppression precedes orientation tuned surround suppression. These results also reveal a previously unrecognized similarity between surround suppression and crowding (Pelli, Palomares, & Majaj, 2004).},

This cross-orientation suppression (COS) is exhibited when the orthogonal and optimal stimuli are presented to the same eye (monoptically) or to different eyes (dichoptically). A recent study suggested that monoptic COS arises from subcortical processes; however, the mechanisms underlying dichoptic COS were not addressed. We have compared the temporal frequency tuning and stimulus adaptation properties of monoptic and dichoptic COS. We found that dichoptic COS is best elicited with lower temporal frequencies and is substantially reduced after prolonged adaptation to a mask grating. In contrast, monoptic COS is more pronounced with mask gratings at much higher temporal frequencies and is less prone to stimulus adaptation. These results suggest that monoptic COS is mediated by subcortical mechanisms, whereas intracortical inhibition is the mechanism for dichoptic COS.},

@article{Baker2007,
	abstract = {Visual mechanisms in primary visual cortex are suppressed by the superposition of gratings perpendicular to their preferred orientations. A clear picture of this process is needed to (i) inform functional architecture of image-processing models, (ii) identify the pathways available to support binocular rivalry, and (iii) generally advance our understanding of early vision. Here we use monoptic sine-wave gratings and cross-orientation masking (XOM) to reveal two cross-oriented suppressive pathways in humans, both of which occur before full binocular summation of signals. One is a within-eye (ipsiocular) pathway that is spatially broadband, immune to contrast adaptation and has a suppressive weight that tends to decrease with stimulus duration. The other pathway operates between the eyes (interocular), is spatially tuned, desensitizes with contrast adaptation and has a suppressive weight that increases with stimulus duration. When cross-oriented masks are presented to both eyes, masking is enhanced or diminished for conditions in which either ipsiocular or interocular pathways dominate masking, respectively. We propose that ipsiocular suppression precedes the influence of interocular suppression and tentatively associate the two effects with the lateral geniculate nucleus (or retina) and the visual cortex respectively. The interocular route is a good candidate for the initial pathway involved in binocular rivalry and predicts that interocular cross-orientation suppression should be found in cortical cells with predominantly ipsiocular drive.},

@article{Petrov2005,
	abstract = {Cortical visual neurons in the cat and monkey are inhibited by stimuli surrounding their receptive fields (surround suppression) or presented within their receptive fields (cross-orientation or overlay suppression). We show that human contrast sensitivity is similarly affected by two distinct suppression mechanisms. In agreement with the animal studies, human surround suppression is tightly tuned to the orientation and spatial frequency of the test, unlike overlay suppression. Using a double-masking paradigm, we also show that in humans, overlay suppression precedes surround suppression in the processing sequence. Surprisingly, we find that, unlike overlay suppression, surround suppression is only strong in the periphery (> 1 degree eccentricity). This result argues for a new functional distinction between foveal and peripheral operations.},
